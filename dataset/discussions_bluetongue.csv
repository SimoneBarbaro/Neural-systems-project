2004704,0,"Cattle in SA are normally not affected by BTV outbreaks. Clinical signs have been reported in only two outbreaks of BT in cattle: in 1996–1997 in the Delareyville District in the North-West Province and in Donkerhoek in Bronkhorstspruit District, Gauteng Province (Barnard, Gerdes & Meiswinkel 1998). The prevalence of BTV in cattle in SA is, however, not known. To obtain BTV antibody negative cattle for this study and in a recent study by Steyn et al. (2015), 2168 cattle were bled in different geographical regions in SA (Gauteng, Mpumalanga and North-West Province) and a total of 96.5% of the cattle tested positive to BTV antibodies. It is therefore clear that although cattle have a high infection prevalence, they do not normally show any clinical signs and consequently are also not, in general, vaccinated against BTV in SA. It can therefore be concluded that cattle can be considered amplifying or maintenance hosts of the virus (MacLachlan et al. 1994). The trial was conducted during winter when midge numbers decrease significantly, therefore minimising the risk of natural infection with BTV."
2004704,1,"During this trial, cattle showed no adverse effects of stress, with the exception of two of the cattle that were inoculated with the vaccine and the wild-type virus and developed a mild fever and loss of appetite for 1 day. Animals were viraemic from 2 to 39 days post-infection. No virus could be detected in four animals after day 33 post-infection using virus isolation, but two animals were viraemic up to 39 days post-infection. Only one of the animals with the prolonged viraemic period showed some mild signs as discussed earlier. This is in agreement with previous studies in which it has been reported that cattle can be viraemic for periods between 14 and 100 days post-infection (Sellers & Taylor 1980; Singer, MacLachlan & Carpenter 2001)."
2004704,2,"When the isolated viruses were compared to each other and to the vaccine strains using PAGE, the majority of the samples were similar to BTV 4 the wild-type strain. This might be because BTV 4 was inoculated intravenously resulting in high titres of BTV 4 in the blood compared to the vaccine serotypes that were inoculated subcutaneously according to the guidelines of the manufacturer. Another reason might be that the fastest multiplying viruses showing plaques on cell cultures were preferentially selected; thus, the virulent field strain was isolated rather than the attenuated vaccine strains (Dungu et al. 2004)."
2004704,3,"This study illustrated the generation of reassortant viruses between two vaccine strains of BTV in cattle. Segment 8 of MLV BTV 8 reassorted with MLV BTV 9. Segment 8 codes for the NS 2 which is mainly responsible for assembly of the virion (Kar et al. 2007). It can therefore be hypothesised that the reassortant virus described in this study may replicate faster to facilitate survival. Reassortment is not limited to vaccine serotypes or closely related serotypes. Maan et al. (2012) illustrated that reassortment can occur between unrelated viruses, for example, from the western and eastern lineages. Whole genome analysis of a serotype 2 isolate from India illustrated that segment 9 was unique and belonged to the eastern topotype, while segment 5 belonged to a western topotype. Another example from India was the reassortment between a field isolate of BTV 21 and 16. Whole genome sequencing confirmed segment 6 of BTV 21 clustered with BTV 16 and showed a 97.6% similarity (Shafiq et al. 2013). A study in 1987 illustrated reassortment between two field virus isolates after a Holstein Bull was inoculated with BTV 11 and 17. The isolated viruses were compared with electrophoretic profiles and 16 unique profiles were identified (Stott et al. 1987). More recent studies in Europe illustrated how BTV 16, a field isolate from Italy, and BTV 2 vaccine strain exchanged segment 5 (Batten et al. 2008) and the circulation of a BTV 6 MLV strain was detected in the eastern Netherlands and later in parts of Germany in cattle that displayed mild non-specific clinical signs of BT (Maan et al. 2010)."
2004704,4,"Whole genome sequences were performed on 116 BTV isolates from Europe, the Mediterranean region and African countries collected during 1958–2012. The isolates were compared to four MLV serotypes and compared to the 26 serotypes available on GenBank, which revealed reassortment between field isolates and vaccine strains as well as reassortment between field isolates (Nomikou et al. 2015)."
2004704,5,"The impact of BTV reassortment on the epidemiology of the disease in SA has not been studied, but reported studies indicated that it is possible that new emerging viruses can infect novel species (Purse et al. 2005). In a recent study by Weyer et al. (2017), it was confirmed that individual outbreaks of African horse sickness (caused by AHSV) in the Western Cape Province, SA, were caused by virulent revertants of the virus. Outbreaks were caused by AHSV serotype 1 live-attenuated vaccine and reassortants with genome segments derived from AHSV serotypes 1, 3 and 4 from a live-attenuated vaccine used in SA."
2004704,6,"It is not possible to predict to what extent the characteristics of new emerging viruses can change and what the limitations of such changes will be. The new virus can be more pathogenic especially if reassortment results in reversion to virulence, can cross the placenta increasing its overwintering capabilities, or susceptibility to the vector resulting in more efficient spread of the virus (reviewed by Wilson, Darpel & Mellor 2008)."
342394,0,"Bluetongue disease constitutes one of the major veterinary problems in sheep and North American white-tailed deer [12,13]. However, in focal areas of endemicity, goats and cattle develop subclinical infection [6,8,10]. In our laboratory, a lot of research efforts have been made to facilitate rapid molecular detection and differentiation of orbiviruses, including BTV, in susceptible native breeds of livestock [11,13,15,17,24,27-33]."
342394,1,"Previous epidemiological surveys showed high prevalence rates for BTV infections in Iran (93.5%) and Southern Turkey (88%) [34,35]. In Sudan, earlier serological surveys indicated that BT infection is generally widespread and occurs in all domestic ruminants, with as high as 61.5% prevalence rate among sheep in Juba, South Sudan [22]. A subsequent serological survey for antibodies against bluetongue in cattle in Khartoum State showed high prevalence rate of 51.1% among the examined animals [23]. In the present study, a seroprevalence of BTV infection in cattle of North Kordufan (19.4%) is markedly lower than previously reported prevalence rates compared to other states of Sudan. In this study, the prevalence of BT disease is comparable to those reported amongst sheep in El-Dien (20%), Western Sudan, and Atbara (21.9), Northern Sudan [22]. The presence of BT disease in Sudan and the risks these infected cattle pose for native breeds of sheep, necessitate the importance of an improved surveillance system for this viral pathogen in Sudan. In the present investigation, the final models of BTV seropositive cattle indicated that only three independent risk factors were statistically significant. When assessing age as risk factor, there was a significant difference between the BTV infection rate and the age of the animal. It was shown that the calves started to get infected with BTV after the age of 2 years. At this age, the animals are usually released onto the pasture for grazing, where they are likely to be exposed to infected vectors and subsequent BTV infection. We believe that the association of BTV infection rate and age is probably attributed to frequent exposure of older cattle to infected Culicoides vectors. In contrast, young calves (<2 years) are usually kept indoors and are well taken care of by the animal owners for protection against infectious diseases particularly, the insect and tick-borne infections [36]. Our result is in agreement with previous epidemiological surveys, which reported higher risks of older animals for BTV infections [37]. It should be noted that the BTV-specific antibodies detected among cattle in North Kordufan State indicate natural infection as there is no vaccination program for the disease in the country. In addition, all cattle included in this study are aged over one year. Therefore, it is assumed that detected antibodies no longer persisted and that antibody indicated direct exposure to BTV. In addition, there was association between body condition and BTV seropositivity. In our study, poor physical conditions are associated with highest prevalence of infection. It is probable that emaciated cattle have the tendency to attract the infected Culicoides insect vector of BTV. However, if the status of emaciation causes infection by BTV or vice versa needs further investigation and cannot be derived from this study. Regarding the management risk factors, there was a significant difference between the use of insecticide and the seropositivity to BTV infected cattle. It is, therefore, recommended that routine application of insecticide or insect repellents be considered to prevent BTV infection in susceptible livestock. In contrast, the risk assessment studies indicated that there was no significant difference between BTV infection and the rest of the individual or management risk factors included in the study. It is worth mentioning that gender has no significant difference for BTV infection among male and females as both sexes are equally infected with BTV. Likewise, there was no significant difference between localities and BTV infection rate, suggesting wide distribution of the Culicoides vector all over the localities of North Kordufan State. Highest and lowest rates of BTV positivity were recorded in the localities of Shiekan (15%) and Ennuhud (27.5%), respectively. The high level of BTV positivity in Ennuhud is attributed to the substantial rainfall events and development of irrigation projects, which provide suitable habitat for the insect vector in this locality. However, the locality of Shiekan is situated in the semi desert zone and hence has restricted rainfall."
2087253,0,"Infection with BTV is common in a broad band across the world, which until recently stretched from latitude ~35°S to 40–50°N. Since the 1990s, the range of BTV has extended considerably north of the 40th and even the 50th parallels in some parts of the world (Maan et al. 2007; Coetzee et al. 2012)."
2087253,1,"All attenuated BTV strains have pronounced reactogenic properties. These properties are characterized by the appearance in the vaccinated animal of a quite moderate to severe reaction temperature, between 6 and 10 days after vaccination. The response to the vaccine is followed by viremia. These phenomena are regarded as positive signs of infection, indicating the development of an immune response (Kercher et al. 1957)."
2087253,2,"One of the most important steps when preparing a live-attenuated vaccine is the assessment of its level of attenuation in the target animals (sheep and newborn mice). These models, which are used to evaluate the attenuation of BTV, are sufficient to test the attenuated strains (Franchi et al. 2008). Therefore, we determined the levels of attenuation of the BTV strains with 10 serial passages in sheep. We evaluated the reversion of the two vaccine strains by passaging them 10 times through susceptible sheep, and thus showed that the pathogenicity of these attenuated strains was not restored. However, these strains replicated in the sheep and could be isolated from the blood of the animals 2–12 days after vaccination."
2087253,3,"The MLV vaccine administered at doses not exceeding 2.0 log10 TCID50/mL, produced long-lasting viremia in the sheep, whereas virulent strains accumulated in the blood at levels up to 5.50 log10 TCID50/mL. Although this viremia makes the MLV more immunogenic, because it continues to producing an immune response long after the initial injection, the possibility of reversion to virulence cannot be ruled out given the limitations of the present study. In particular, previous research has shown that the virus can revert to virulence after infecting its natural vectors (Batten et al. 2008). In this case, the viremia produced by the vaccine strain persisted longer than that induced by the pathogenic strains. Vaccination with MLV and inactivated viruses produces neutralizing and group-specific antibodies (Oura et al. 2009; Hamers et al. 2009) protecting the vaccinated animal against challenge. Live-attenuated vaccines usually elicit a strong immune response, with the development of antibodies, and are usually efficacious after a single dose (Patta et al. 2004; Dungu et al. 2008)."
2087253,4,"Neutralizing antibodies have been shown to be an essential component of the protective immune response against BTV (Huismans et al. 1987; Roy et al. 1990) and similar titers, (1.5–2.5 log2) have been observed after vaccination with killed commercial vaccines in ruminants, which were ultimately protected from BTV-8 challenge (Bréard et al. 2011). Our experimental data are consistent with those of other researchers. Therefore, we have established that 7 days after vaccination with the attenuated vaccine, virus-neutralizing antibodies to BTV are present in the sera at a titers of 1.0 log2. This antibody titer is protective against the homologous virulent strain of BTV. Although further research isrequired, particularly regarding the safety of the vaccine in pregnant sheep, this bivalent vaccine has been shown to be safe and efficacious, and will be a valuable tool in preventing the spread of bluetongue to Kazakhstan."
761719,0,"It is worth mentioning that the situation of diagnosis of this virus in neighboring countries and the Middle-East (except Turkey and Occupied Palestine) is not better than our country. In such country as Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen and Pakistan, the presence of virus has been documented only relying on serological tests.6,7,16 According to recent studies, there is an evidence of occurrence of BT disease in tropical and subtropical countries (such as Iran). In such areas generally, the disease appears sub clinically and does not attract attention. In such circumstances, the presence of the virus often confirms via serological evidence. It should be mentioned that in such foci, in spite of unrevealed disease and manifestation, sometimes sudden incidence of acute forms of the disease sustain a loss.17-19"
761719,1,"In Iran, identification of BTV in suspected cattle and sheep based on clinical manifestations was performed. However, there are some limitations and problems. First, it should be considered that clinical expression of BTV regarding strain and virus intensity, cattle race and environmental condition varies from per acute to subclinical. Second, symptoms of disease in sheep can be mistaken with those of other viral much diseases and even some of the non-viral diseases.19 The objectives of the used C-ELISA test were both to confirm the BTV infected status of sheep in suspicious holdings in west and northwest of Iran (Diagnostic test). Thus, its use has been more and more often abandoned and replaced by C-ELISA tests, which are rapid and easier to use, more sensitive and specific.20 In this study, the prevalence rate of BT antibodies in sheep was 40.87%. In other countries, the prevalence was as follows: 21.40% in Kazakhstan,6 29.59% in southeastern Turkey,14 62.69% in India,21 54.10% in Saudi Arabia,22 and 48.70% in Pakistan.16 Climatic factors play an important role in the occurrence of BTV infection in animals and influence the size of vector populations and periods of their seasonal activity.23 An analysis of climatic data was used to model the potential distribution of Culicoides imicola in Europe, predicting that might have spread from Spain, Greece and Italy to some areas along the Croatian coast as well as to the coastal areas of Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina.24-27 Although more than 1000 species of Culicoides spp. are known worldwide, relatively few of these species have been incriminated as vectors of BTV.28 Culicoides from western Turkey in relation to bluetongue disease of sheep and cattle was reported.29 Species of vector insects that transmit BTV differ amongst regions, and are especially poorly characterized in the portions of Asia that are devoid of C. imicola, the traditional African-Asian vector of BTV.2,7,29 Animals entering the western border of Iraq to Iran can be a cause of high titers of antibodies against the bluetongue virus in west of Iran. The prevalence of BT antibodies in sheep in the northwest of Iran was 33.75%. Although BTV infection of sheep is clearly widespread in northwest of Iran, the specific virus serotypes and vector insects that occur within the region remain uncharacterized, as they are in adjacent countries such as Kazakhstan.6 The highest prevalence of BTV in sheep was in West Azerbaijan (64.86%) and Ilam (42.65%)."
761719,2,"The results show that BTV infection is present in live-stock animals in province. Some similar studies have been carried out in different area of country that mostly reported prevalence in the similar study. For example, 76.44% in East Azerbaijan,30 34.70% in West Azerbaijan,7 33.33% in Kerman,31 45.90% in Kurdistan, 32 53.37% in Isfahan.33"
761719,3,"Furthermore, BTV infection in sheep apparently is largely subclinical.7 During the BTV epidemics in Europe in 2008, Williamson and colleagues34 considered clinical signs for diagnosis of the disease. The results showed low specificity of this method. These researchers believe that sometimes clinical signs of BTV in sheep are mistaken with those of such diseases as foot and mouth disease (FMD), ovine rinderpest, contagious ecthyma, and hemonchosis.35,36 Iran located in the southeast of Europe makes it an important potential source of BTV strains and serotypes that might incur into adjacent areas.5,37"
761719,4,"In conclusion, seroprevalence of BTV has been never before reported in many area of Iran (Ardabil and Ilam). As per our knowledge, this is the first study was evaluated the prevalence of antibodies to BTV in sheep in some provinces of Iran. The results showed that a high incidence rate of BT antibodies has been detected in sheep in Iran that indicate serological evidence of exposure to infection was widely distributed in some provinces. There are no restrictions on the movement of animals from one region to another within the country. Thus, outbreaks may also occur due to transportation of animals. Consequently, a well-defined control strategy for preventing and controlling the BTV may be based not only on vaccination plans and vector eradication but also restriction on the movement of animals from one region to another within the country. As a vaccination for BT is not implemented in Iran, a seropositive result indicates BT infection in domestic population.4,31 Further researches on the isolation and identification of BT virus in sheep are encouraged."
921211,0,"In this study, we showed that NS4 is an IFN antagonist and a virulence factor for BTV. BTV NS4 deletion mutants replicate as efficiently as wild-type viruses in cell lines that lack a competent innate immune system and are lethal to IFNAR−/− mice (8). In contrast, here, we demonstrated that NS4 facilitates BTV replication in vitro in IFN-competent cells and in vivo in sheep, the animal species most affected by bluetongue."
921211,1,"BTV induces a type 1 IFN response in vivo and in vitro (38,–42). Our data strongly suggest that NS4 is required by the virus to help overcome the cellular innate antiviral responses. Reporter assays revealed that NS4 can inhibit transcription from a variety of mammalian and viral promoters while having little if any direct impact on mRNA editing or translation. However, NS4 does appear to influence the extent of the host IFN response, as supernatants of primary sheep endothelial cells infected with BTV8ΔNS4 contained more IFN than supernatants collected from BTV8wt-infected cells, a result that may explain the more efficient growth of BTVwt in IFN-competent cells. These results were supported by RNA-seq analyses of nascent RNA isolated from infected and mock-infected cells. Genes relating to the innate immune system were among the most upregulated genes in BTV8ΔNS4-infected cells, even if some of them were also found to be upregulated in BTV8wt-infected cells, suggesting that NS4 is not by itself sufficient to entirely inhibit the host IFN response. Most of the genes that were specifically upregulated in BTV8ΔNS4-infected cells compared to BTV8wt-infected cells were ISGs, including those encoding well-characterized antiviral factors."
921211,2,"Overall, the data obtained in this study indicate that NS4 exerts its effect upon the antiviral host response at a point upstream of RNA editing and translation. Interestingly, NS4 possesses features of a transcription factor of the bZip family, with a basic domain followed by a leucine zipper motif (67), and it has been suggested to have the ability to bind DNA, based on DNase protection assays (9). Our reporter assays, showing that NS4 inhibits transcription from a variety of promoters, including IFN-β and an ISRE-containing promoter, suggest that the protein may inhibit cellular transcription. In a previous study, we showed that NS4 displays nucleolar localization in infected cells (8). Thus, a direct interaction of NS4 with transcription factors and/or chromatin resulting in the downregulation of cellular transcription is a possible mechanism of action for the protein. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the NS4 protein of a BTV-1 strain that did not show nucleolar localization was not able to modulate gene expression in reporter assays. It is also possible that NS4 inhibits IFN-β activation before transcription. Nuclear translocation of IRF-3 and NF-κB appeared to occur at similar levels in both BTVwt- and BTVΔNS4-infected cells, suggesting that NS4 does not prevent PAMP recognition by host cells. However, it is possible that IRF-3 or NF-κB could be inhibited by NS4 in the nucleus. It is important to note that, in a previous study, we showed that NS4 confers a replication advantage on BTV in cells pretreated with type I IFN, highlighting its ability to counteract the innate immune response after IFN activation. Hence, it is less likely that NS4 blocks PAMP recognition and subsequent signaling. More studies will be necessary to fully dissect how NS4 counteracts the host innate immune system. Obviously, NS4, like other nonstructural proteins of different viruses, might have different functions and antagonize the IFN response via multiple mechanisms. For example, the NS1 protein of influenza A viruses inhibits IFN production by blocking IRF3 and NF-κB activation and mRNA maturation (68, 69)."
921211,3,"It has been known for at least 3 decades that BTV induces host protein synthesis shutdown (22, 64, 65). Recent studies suggest that BTV NS1 favors viral RNA translation and therefore competes with cellular protein synthesis (22). A key difference between mammalian and BTV transcripts is the lack of a poly(A) tail. The NSP3 protein of rotaviruses (also members of the Reoviridae) acts in a similar fashion and outcompetes the poly(A) binding protein of cells, thus biasing translation of viral transcripts (70, 71). It remains possible that a similar mechanism may exist for BTV. Our data, obtained in metabolically labeled cells, confirm that BTV induces host protein synthesis shutdown and also establishes that this occurs largely independently of NS4. Hence, other BTV proteins might also play a similar role in the shutoff of host cell protein synthesis or function in different ways as IFN antagonists. For example, NS3 is believed to modulate IFN induction downstream of RIG-I and upstream of IKKε activation. Therefore, NS3 and NS4 may potentially act synergistically to counteract the innate immune system (28). In addition, it has also been shown that BTV inhibits the IFN signaling pathway by downregulating key components of the JAK/STAT pathway: JAK1 and TYK2 (43). The downregulation of JAK1/TYK2 may be the result of a specific interaction with a BTV protein and/or due to the general host protein synthesis shutdown induced by the virus. We did not find either of the two genes to be differentially expressed in BTV8wt- or BTV8ΔNS4-infected cells."
921211,4,"In this study, we showed that BTV8ΔNS4-infected sheep display lower levels of viremia, lasting for shorter periods, than the viremia observed in animals infected with BTV8wt. The levels and duration of viremia in infected animals are essential factors for successful transmission between the mammalian hosts and the intermediate arthropod vectors. As mentioned above, BTV infection can result in a lethal hemorrhagic fever in some animals, while in others, the virus induces a mild febrile illness or even a clinically unapparent infection. The data obtained in this study provide evidence that viral proteins modulating the host innate immune response play a significant role in viral pathogenesis. This study lays the foundations for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which BTV antagonizes the IFN system, in turn helping us to define the molecular determinants of BTV virulence."
1200121,0,"From this study it is revealed that antibodies to BTV is highly prevalent in sheep and goats of south west Ethiopia. The results of the present study revealed the first confirmation of BTV antibody in sheep and goats from South west Ethiopia. Although, seropositivity to bluetongue virus has been reported earlier in small ruminants in Ethiopia, it has covered only a small region without mentioning the association of risk factors [9, 10, 13]. In the present study 30.6% (129/4220 serum samples of small ruminants were found positive to antibodies to BTV. This findings is in agreement with the results of Gulima [10] who reported 34.1% seropositivity to BTV in indigenous sheep of Northwestern Ethiopia. The seropositivity to BTV in small ruminants (28.6%) in India [14], domestic livestock (23%) in Kazakhstan [15], sheep in Iran (35.9%) [16], sheep in Iran (34.93%) [17], goats in Iran (39.47%) [18], small ruminants in Turkey (29.5%) [19], sheep in Iran (37.7%) [20] and again sheep in Iran (33.75%) [21] has also been reported from other parts of the world."
1200121,1,"The present finding is found to be relatively lower than the previously reported seroprevalence to BTV in small ruminants by different authors in different countries such as 41.17% in small ruminants in Southern Ethiopia [13], 46.67% in sheep in central Ethiopia [9], 78.4% in small ruminants in Grenada [22] and 45.7% in small ruminant in India [23]. However, 30.6% seropositivity to BTV in small ruminants in the present study is comparatively higher than the reports of other researchers like 6.57% in sheep in Southeast Iran [21], 6.96% from small ruminants (13.7% in goats and 5.70% in sheep) in Algeria [24], 2.63 and 5.3% in small ruminants in Kerala and Karnataka (India) [25, 26] respectively. In the present study, the difference in the seropositivity might be due to difference in animal species, age of sampled animals, immune status of sampled animals, agroclimatic zones, ecology, and types of culicoides vectors."
1200121,2,"In the current study, seropositivity to BTV in goats was higher than sheep. Higher seroprevalence among goats compared to sheep indicating that goats play an pivotal role in the epidemiology of BTV. Whereas, sheep which are highly susceptible animals to BT show distinct clinical signs and die of the disease. It is also an established fact that goats with minimum clinical manifestation maintain high titer of BTV and may be the potential source of infection to other susceptible animals [13, 14]."
1200121,3,"It has been recorded that BT virus infection is increased with increasing age of animals and this is in agreement with the reports of Yilma and Mekonnen [13]. Assessing age as a risk factor, there was a statistically significant association (P < 0.05) with the prevalence of BTV specific antibody in the study animals. It was shown that the younger animals started to get infected with BTV after the age of included at category of adult level. At this age, the animals are usually released into the pasture for grazing, where they are likely to be exposed to infection by vectors and subsequent BTV infection. Young age groups are usually kept indoors and are well taken care of by the owners from contracting infectious diseases, particularly the insect and tick-borne infections [27, 28]."
1200121,4,"This study was also assessed the effect of agro ecology on the seroprevalence of the BTV antibody and found that animals at low altitude are more prone to BTV infection than high altitude. This is in agreement with different authors [18, 22]. The prevalence correlated with the probable distribution of the Culicoides vector. In addition environmental changes can influence the incidence, distribution and evolution of infectious diseases, particularly those transmitted by arthropod vectors [29]."
921401,0,"Most infections of susceptible hosts by pathogenic viruses result in clinical manifestations that can vary greatly in their severity. For some viruses, such as avian influenza virus, for example, low and highly virulent strains are distinguishable by clear genotypic differences (76). Nevertheless, in some circumstances, even infection of susceptible hosts with highly pathogenic viruses can result in mild or unapparent clinical symptoms."
921401,1,"Bluetongue is a disease characterized by a highly variable clinical spectrum (21,–24). Understanding the basis for this variability is complicated by the fact that BTV exists in nature as many diverse strains representing different serotypes, topotypes, and reassortant viruses often cocirculating in the same geographical area. In addition, BTV can infect a variety of ruminant species, each with different genetic and immunological backgrounds. Furthermore, BTV is transmitted by different species of Culicoides in diverse ecological contexts. There have been several studies concerning naturally occurring bluetongue or experimentally induced disease, clearly indicating that factors related to both the mammalian host and the virus can influence the outcome of BTV infection (55). However, it is not always straightforward to compare data from different studies. Thus, the weight given to different host or virus factors in determining the clinical outcome to BTV infection can differ in heterogeneous ecological or experimental settings."
921401,2,"In this study, we dissected both host and virus factors that can affect the clinical outcome of BTV infection. The use of a uniform experimental framework has allowed us to rigorously interrogate both experimental questions addressed in past studies (55), as well as to explore hitherto unanswered questions. First of all, as suggested previously (24, 32,–36), we confirmed that while both sheep and goats are fully susceptible to BTV (in this case BTV-8) infection, the former are more susceptible than goats and more likely to develop clinical disease. The levels of viremia in BTV-infected goats were not different from (if anything, higher than) those observed in infected sheep. These data confirm that BTV is able to replicate to high levels in goat tissues but cellular damage, either induced by the virus or the host immune responses, does not likely occur. We do not know if goats would be more susceptible to disease if we had used higher infectious doses. We have used 2 × 106 PFU of BTV in our experimental infections, and this is likely far more infectious virus than is transmitted in nature by infected midges. In addition, studies in sheep using as little as 101.4 TCID50 were able to induce infection in this animal species (66). In two previous studies, also using BTV-8 isolates from the Netherlands, some of the experimentally infected goats developed mild clinical signs, fever, and viremia (34, 36). However, in both studies, goats were infected intravenously (34, 36), and in one of them animals were infected at day 62 of gestation (36). Another study used BTV-4, which was isolated in embryonated chicken eggs and passaged seven times in BHK21. Only 1 of 11 goats (of two different breeds) infected with this virus showed transient pyrexia, but at the same time 10 of 12 inoculated sheep did not show fever or signs of disease either (32). Thus, this study confirmed that the mammalian host species is certainly one of the main factors that determine the clinical outcome of BTV infection."
921401,3,"We did not find major differences in the susceptibility of sheep breeds from the Mediterranean area (Sardinian and Italian mixed breed) and Northern European breeds (Dorset poll) to bluetongue, despite their distinct geographical, historical, and breeding backgrounds (47). Thus, variations in the susceptibility to bluetongue of different sheep breeds might not be as pronounced as originally thought. It is also important to stress that bluetongue itself was first discovered in European breeds imported into South Africa (77). Those breeds showed a higher susceptibility to bluetongue than local animals, although the influence of herd immunity on the latter could have also played a role. It is therefore difficult to weigh the influences of the host's genetic background, previous BTV exposure, or the insect vector on the susceptibility to the disease in that particular context."
921401,4,"We have also analyzed the influence of divergent viral serotypes, and closely related but distinct strains within the same serotype, on the clinical outcome of bluetongue. BTV-8NET2006 is considered to be a highly pathogenic virus (both in terms of morbidity and mortality) and the cause of one of the largest outbreaks of bluetongue in history (48,–51). However, in our experimental setting, we did not find any difference in virulence between BTV-8NET2006 and another serotype, such as BTV-2IT2000, which was isolated in Italy in the year 2000 from a naturally occurring case of bluetongue in sheep. Another study, comparing the virulence of BTV-1 isolated from Algeria and a 2006 isolate of BTV-8 from Belgium, concluded that the former was more virulent than the latter (78). Although in that particular study the cell culture passage history was not described and viruses were inoculated subcutaneously, it appears that the overall data suggest that in itself BTV-8NET2006 is not necessarily more virulent than other BTV serotypes, such as BTV-2 or BTV-1, that have been circulating in Europe in the last decade. It is likely that other factors, such as the rapid spread of the infection to an extremely large number of fully susceptible and naive hosts (never previously exposed even to heterologous BTV serotypes), contributed to the number of severe cases of disease observed during the Northern European outbreak caused by this strain of BTV."
921401,5,"The BTV-8NET2006 strain was isolated from samples collected at the beginning of the European outbreak of this virus. Since the original cases identified in 2006 in central Europe, BTV-8 moved in subsequent years toward several surrounding geographical areas (including southward). Interestingly, in Northern Italy and in Sardinia, BTV-8 (termed in this study BTV-8IT2008) was detected only at the serological level in a few animals, but it was not associated with clinical disease (G. Savini, personal communication). We showed conclusively in our study that BTV-8IT2008 was less virulent than BTV-8NET2006. BTV-8IT2008 accumulated several nonsynonymous mutations in structural and nonstructural proteins (including VP1, VP2, NS1, and NS2) already implicated in attenuation of tissue culture-adapted BTV-2, BTV-4, and BTV-9 (57). Thus, this study formally proves the appearance of less virulent strains during a BTV outbreak. The comparative smaller number of severe cases of bluetongue in areas where it is endemic might depend upon several factors, including the levels of herd immunity, the decrease in virulence of circulating BTV strains, and, possibly, the long-term selection of genetically resistant individual animals."
921401,6,"Finally, we further investigated the observation that experimental infection of sheep with blood collected from naturally occurring cases of bluetongue appears to induce, in general, more severe clinical cases compared to the disease induced in sheep infected with viruses isolated in tissue culture or embryonated eggs (20, 61). Indeed, we have confirmed in our experimental framework that sheep inoculated with BTV-8NET2007(blood) displayed a more severe disease and higher levels of viremia than those infected with the virus isolated in cell culture [BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK)]. It is unlikely that factors present in the infected blood could be the cause of more severe clinical signs in sheep. Importantly, the highest levels of fever and the most severe clinical signs in sheep infected with BTV-8NET2007(blood) were observed between days 6 and 11 p.i., when the levels of BTV in the blood were at their highest."
921401,7,"Virus passaging in tissue culture can lead to adaptive changes in the viral genotype that could in turn affect viral virulence. However, we found only 2 synonymous mutations between the consensus sequence of BTV-8NET2007(blood) and the cell culture-isolated virus BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK). Both mutations were present in approximately 10% of the variants of BTV-8NET2007(blood), and interestingly they were both selected in two independent experiments. It is possible that these silent mutations in some way affect viral virulence. In addition, the sequencing methods used did not cover the noncoding regions of each segment, and therefore we may have also missed other important mutations. However, overall there appears to be very little (or no variation at all) at the consensus sequence level (at least for BTV-8) of viruses isolated from blood or minimally passaged in cell culture. RNA viruses have the highest error rates (10−4 to 10−6 per nucleotide site per genome replication) of any microorganism due to their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacking proofreading activity during RNA synthesis (79, 80). As such, RNA viruses exist as a population of variants, genetically closely related but distinct from their consensus sequence. It is rational to argue that the opportunity to quickly adapt and generate diverse viral populations is critical for the survival of RNA viruses (74) in the face of selective pressures, including the innate and adaptive antiviral responses of the host. For example, poliovirus mutants with a high-fidelity polymerase (and thus low population diversity) display an attenuated phenotype in mice, despite possessing identical consensus sequences to the virulent wild-type viruses (81,–83)."
921401,8,"We found that BTV-8NET2007(blood) contained the largest number of high-frequency variants. However, when BTV-8NET2007(blood) was passaged in insect KC cells, the resulting viral population [BTV-8NET2007(1KC)] showed the overall highest number of variants, even higher (∼ 60%) than those in the blood before tissue culture isolation. A severe genetic bottleneck was observed after viral passaging in mammalian BHK21 cells, with the resulting viruses [BTV-8NET2007(1KC-1BHK) and BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK)] showing the smallest degree of variability."
921401,9,"These data suggest that BTV virulence is affected not only by changes in the viral proteins selected at the consensus level but also by the genetic variability of the population as a whole. This hypothesis is also supported by previous observations made in a limited number of genes before the advent of deep sequencing (84, 85). In a study that analyzed segment 2 of a virulent strain of BTV-1, Gould and Eaton (84) showed that the consensus sequence did not change after a single passage in tissue culture that resulted in viral attenuation. In addition, Bonneau and colleagues (85) showed that the number of variants observed in segment 2 and 10 of plaque-purified BTV-10 increased during transmission of the virus between ruminants and insect vectors but without changes to the consensus sequence."
921401,10,"Thus, “flat” populations containing a relatively small number of variants appear to be less virulent than more variable populations."
921401,11,"In addition, our data also suggest that Culicoides cells might function as a natural source of new BTV variants. BTV is an arbovirus and as such must adapt rapidly to replicate in hosts as different as a warm-blooded mammal and insects. An increased variability of replication in Culicoides cells might allow BTV to adapt faster to different selective pressures present in the invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. These data also reinforce the notion that it is critical to avoid the use of modified live vaccines that induce even transient viremia in vaccinated animals. The transmission of vaccine strains in the Culicoides population might then lead to the emergence of “new” strains with the potential to revert to their original phenotype."
921401,12,"Our study has not taken into consideration factors related to the invertebrate host (e.g., species and sites and number of “infectious” bites) that could affect BTV pathogenesis. The insect host certainly plays a role in modulating the interaction between virus and the mammalian host, as some studies are beginning to suggest (86). It is possible that transmission of BTV by different species of Culicoides, in different geographical areas, could influence the pathogenesis of bluetongue in different ways. This is an exceedingly important area of research that will need to be addressed in the coming years."
2299383,0,"Sheep and cattle in the selected herds in this study were commonly exposed to BTV, concurring with previous studies in Zimbabwe. Musuka and Kelly (2000) recorded sero-prevalences of antibodies against BTV in sheep and goats of up to 100% in the north-east of Zimbabwe while Jorgensen et al. (1989) reported an overall sero-prevalence of 71% in indigenous goats at 25 farms across Zimbabwe. Prevalence rates of BTV antibodies, ranging from 64% to 84%, have been reported in sheep and goat populations in South Africa (Gerdes 2004). In North Africa, BTV sero-prevalences in Algeria were found to be only 14% in sheep and 29% in cattle (Madani et al. 2011). In 455 calves sampled in Kenya, BTV antibodies were found in 94% of these animals (Toye et al. 2013). Cattle rarely show clinical signs of BT, however, and are, therefore, not vaccinated in Zimbabwe (Musuka & Kelly 2000). It should be noted, however, that the strain of BTV serotype 8, which recently emerged in Europe, appears more pathogenic in cattle than is usually the case for BTV (MacLachlan & Guthrie 2010) so the situation in Zimbabwe may change. Consequently, animal health officials in Zimbabwe should continue to monitor the exposure rates of cattle to BTV and consider the possibility of emerging BTV strains with increased pathogenicity."
2299383,1,"Cattle sentinel herds recorded high sero-prevalences and sero-incidences of antibodies against EHDV in the selected Highveld populations in Zimbabwe. Antibodies against EHDV were detected in 64% of calves tested in Kenya (Toye et al. 2013) and in 38% of cattle and sheep sampled on Reunion Island (Desvars et al. 2015). The low sero-prevalence and sero-incidence rates against this disease recorded in sheep suggest that cattle, which are likely to be the preferred hosts of Culicoides vector species, as in other countries, may be a more natural host of this virus in Zimbabwe, compared to sheep. Whereas EHDV can cause a fulminant haemorrhagic disease syndrome in white-tailed deer, similar infections of ruminant livestock are usually subclinical or clinically inapparent. Nonetheless, it is now widely accepted that EHDV infections in some circumstances have resulted in disease in cattle (Maclachlan et al. 2015). Maclachlan et al. (2015) reported strains of EHDV serotypes 2, 6 and 7 as the apparent recent cause of a BT-like disease syndrome of cattle in northern and southern Africa, Reunion Island, North America and the Mediterranean Basin, including Algeria, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey. Affected cattle in North Africa and Israel exhibited BT-like disease signs when infected with EHDV serotype 7 (MacLachlan & Guthrie 2010). Ibaraki disease, an acute febrile disease in cattle caused by a variant of EHDV serotype 2, was first reported in the central and western parts of Japan in 1959 (Inaba 1975). The host and virus factors that may lead to the expression of EHD in cattle remain, however, undetermined (Maclachlan et al. 2015)."
2299383,2,"In Zimbabwe, the sero-prevalence of antibodies against EHDV was, however, lower than the sero-prevalence of BTV antibodies in both cattle and sheep, suggesting that domestic ruminants in this country are less susceptible to EHDV than BTV, or that the vector species of Culicoides, which transmit EHDV, are different to those that transmit BTV in Zimbabwe. Venter (2015) classified C. imicola as the most important vector of BTV to livestock in South Africa. In the Sudan, Mellor, Osborne and Jennings (1984) isolated BTV only from C. imicola while EHDV isolates were made from Culicoides schultzei group midges. Lee (1979) also reported the isolation of EHD group viruses from C. schultzei collected in Nigeria. Gordon et al. (2015) recorded C. imicola as the most abundant species trapped in Zimbabwe and only recorded very low numbers of Schultzei group midges."
2299383,3,"The highest prevalence of both BTV and EHDV in cattle was detected during the second rainy season (2000/2001). This was a season which recorded above-average rainfall (Department of Meteorological Services, Belvedere, Harare, Zimbabwe). During each rainy season, most seroconversions to the BTV and EHDV occurred towards the end of the season. Mellor (1990) states that this delay reflects the increase in vector numbers and the viraemia, which develops in the infected ruminants, providing a source of infection for further vectors. Large populations of Culicoides vectors have been reported previously in Zimbabwe in areas with high average annual rainfall and summer temperatures (Gordon et al. 2015; Musuka et al. 2001). Large catches of Culicoides have also been recorded in the warm, summer rainfall areas of South Africa (Venter 2015; Venter, Nevill & Van der Linde 1997). Coetzee et al. (2012) state that BT is commonly reported in South Africa in late summer in areas with high rainfall and after good rains. Rainfall data would need to be utilised in future studies to demonstrate the association between rainfall, Culicoides numbers and the sero-incidence of BTV and EHDV in Zimbabwe."
2299383,4,"In this study, the only BTV serotype identified was serotype 3. While this serotype has not been previously reported in Zimbabwe, Coetzee et al. (2012) reported that serotypes 1–6 are commonly encountered in neighbouring South Africa. Sghaier et al. (2017) recently identified serotype 3 in Tunisia while Desvars et al. (2015) attributed BTV-3 as the cause for a clinical outbreak in Merino sheep on Reunion Island. Previous studies have identified BTV serotypes 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 18 from Culicoides vectors in Zimbabwe, although these studies were also restricted to samples from the Highveld region (Blackburn et al. 1985; Gordon et al. 2015). As yet, no data exist on the distribution of BTV or EHDV serotypes in the Middleveld or Lowveld plateaus of Zimbabwe."
2549955,0,"Several studies have modeled the effect of vaccination on BT spread and simulations have demonstrated that vaccination can be a highly effective means to control BT epizootics when a high level (>80%) of vaccine coverage is achieved [14], [15], [17], [18]. However, field studies investigating the effect of vaccination against BTV are rare. To our knowledge, our study is the first to have quantified vaccine induced reductions in the velocity of BTV spread using data from a real epidemic. After accounting for environmental factors known to influence the velocity of BT spread, vaccination divided by a factor 2 the mean velocity at which BTV-1 spread across the study area. Vaccination thus helped to slow down disease progression by decreasing the number of infectious hosts and vectors, and consequently the probability that infected vectors bite susceptible hosts in a non-contaminated area. Despite regulations on farm animal movements, BT has rapidly spread in Europe during the 2006–2008 BTV-1 and BTV-8 epizootics. Vaccination was the only efficient method that could stop BTV-8 and BTV-1 spread, and decrease the number of BT foci until apparent full eradication of BT among European livestock."
2549955,1,"Since previous studies have estimated the velocity of BTV-8 spread in France and the effects of environmental covariates [23], [24], a comparison of BTV-1 and BTV-8 epizootics is possible. In both cases, restrictions were imposed on animal movements. Regarding the velocity of BT spread, the mean value of velocity of spread was similar for both serotypes (5.4 and 5.6 km/day for BTV-1 and BTV-8, respectively). The first and ninth deciles of the estimated velocities were 1.9 and 10.4 km/day for BTV-1 and 3.7 and 7.8 km/day for BTV-8, thus the distribution of estimated velocities appeared narrower for BTV-8 than for BTV-1. Moreover, the lower values of velocities that were observed for BTV-1 than for BTV-8 may be related to the effect of vaccination. Indeed, contrary to what was observed for BTV-1, there was no large area with high vaccine coverage for BTV-8. Regarding the influence of environmental factors, variables related to the ecology of Culicoides vectors (weather and elevation) were the main factors influencing the velocity of BT spread for both serotypes. Weather at a two month-lag plausibly could affect Culicoides abundance through direct effects on demographic life cycle parameters e.g. larvae and pupae require moist habitats, adults are prone to desiccation [3], and temperature is known to influence survival and duration of all stages of life cycle [45]. Weather at a one-month lag is most likely to influence Culicoides activity [46], [47]. The strong negative effect of temperature and the positive effect of rainfall, both at a two-month lag, suggest that in late summer (most clinical cases occurred in August and September) Culicoides dynamics in south-western France become damped when high temperatures exacerbate low level of moisture availability, a combination of factor which is known to induce low survival rates [48], [49]. However, at a one-month lag, monthly averages of maximum daily temperature around 24°C were associated with slightly increased velocities. These apparently contrasting results could reflect that incidence rates were greatest following several months of more or less exponential growth in both vector and virus populations and immediately prior to a desiccation induced crash in vector abundance effectively damping the velocity of further spread. Velocity of BTV-1 spread was also influenced by elevation, the highest velocity being observed for an elevation range between 280 and 454 m. The influence of elevation on velocity of BT spread, which was also observed for BTV-8 [23], was probably related to abundance, species composition and vector competence of the Culicoides vector populations. Indeed, Culicoides populations from the Obsoletus Complex have been found in Europe along a broad altitudinal cline [50], but their abundance changed with elevation. Moreover, Carpenter et al. [51] observed in the United Kingdom a variation of Culicoides susceptibility to BTV infection according to geographic areas within and between species and populations. Similar variation of Culicoides susceptibility and competence may partly explain the effect of elevation on velocity of BT spread. The positive effect of beef cattle density on BTV-1 spread contrasted with the negative effect of dairy cattle density on the BTV-8 spread. This might be related with differences in cattle management practices. Indeed, dairy cattle are kept close to farms, thus creating localized clusters of hosts and a relatively discontinuous pattern of host availability, which might be less favorable to BT spread. By contrast, beef cattle herds tend to be scattered throughout the landscape, a spatial arrangement that facilitates BTV progression [23]. High densities of small ruminants were negatively associated with the velocity of BTV-1 spread, a result that was also observed for BTV-8. With 1.3 million reproductive animals in 2008, dairy sheep farming was more important than meat sheep farming (926,000 reproductive animals) or goat farming (145,000 reproductive animals) in south-western France. Furthermore, according to our 2008 small ruminant count data, dairy sheep flocks are larger than meat sheep flocks, with a mean value of 153 versus 49 animals. Consequently, the negative association between high small ruminant densities and velocity may be due to dairy sheep management practices, which are similar to the dairy cattle management practices mentioned above. Another hypothesis would be that small ruminants were less competent hosts for BTV-1 than cattle, which may cause a dilution effect, and ultimately a negative association between high density of small ruminants and velocity of BTV-1 spread. One landscape-related covariate was significantly linked with velocity: the edge density between arable land and forests. This finding is consistent with previous results as edge density between arable land and forests was identified as a BTV-8 seropositivity risk factor for cattle in France [4]. It was also related to velocity of BTV-8 spread [23]. Arable land may serve as feeding areas for wildlife and forests provide breeding [52] and resting sites [50] for Obsoletus Complex midges. Edges between these habitats may facilitate contacts between BT vectors and wild hosts, then influencing BT dynamics."
2549955,2,"Finally, two potential weaknesses of our study need to be considered. First, we used clinical cases to describe BT spread, and they may suffer from biases because of asymptomatic animals and, to a lesser degree, under-reporting of diseased animals. Consequently, the 1,595 municipalities included in the study might not represent an exhaustive sample of contaminated municipalities. Regarding asymptomatic animals, the severity of BT infection is influenced by various factors including host species, breed, age, individual susceptibility, environmental factors and BTV serotype [53]. Little information is available on BTV-1 clinical signs: the most common clinical signs observed in small ruminants are fever, depression, lethargy, facial edema and salivation [54]. However, a recent experimental study showed that BTV-1 infection induced more marked clinical signs in sheep than BTV-8 infection [55]. Moreover, as farmers received monetary compensation for BT diseased animals, under-reporting was probably rare. We could thus expect limited biases of BTV-1 clinical cases. Furthermore, even if the real BT clinical incidence was underestimated, it did not preclude an unbiased estimate of the spatial trend [56]. A second weakness of our study is that we did not account for wind-mediated vector movements on BT spread [57], [58]. However, our main purposes were to assess the effect of vaccination on BTV-1 spread velocity, and to compare the effect of environmental features on this velocity with previous results obtained for BTV-8. The effect of wind was beyond our scope."
341358,0,"Our study provides evidence for the serological prevalence of circulating antibodies against BTV and RNA of the BTV-1, − 2, − 3, − 15, and − 16 serotypes in the dairy cattle population in South Korea. The present study demonstrated that BTV infection was prevalent in the dairy cattle populations analyzed, in which approximately one in five dairy cattle herds and one in six dairy cattle were infected (Table 1). Further studies might include virological and serological investigations of BTV-4 and -7 circulating in South Korea because neutralizing antibodies against BTV-4 and -7 have been detected in dairy cattle serum samples. However, none of the blood samples in the present study showed virological evidence of BTV-4 and -7. To understand the results of the present study, it is important to know that South Korea has no vaccination program for bluetongue. Thus, the high seroprevalence of BTV infection in South Korea can be assumed to reflect a natural infection of the dairy cattle evaluated."
341358,1,"Briefly, with respect to Asian countries and the Middle East, the overall seroprevalence obtained was lower than that previously reported in this species in Taiwan, Nepal, India, and Japan [31–34], but higher than that previously reported in central and south-east Iran [35, 36]. The seroprevalence of BTV infection described in our study (18.2%) is comparable to that described among sentinel ruminants, such as cattle, buffalo, and goats, in China (17.1% seroprevalence) [37] and Indonesian ruminants (2–23% seroprevalence) [38]. The seroprevalence determined in this study is lower than that described among ruminants in Taiwan (32.7% in cattle and 8.2% in goats) [31], sentinel cattle in Japan (5–71%) [13], and sheep and cattle in Israel (16.7% in sheep and 63.2% cattle) [39] but higher than that reported in domestic yaks in China (2–5%) [23]."
341358,2,"It was noted that 81.1% (28/34) of the seropositive dairy cattle herds clustered at either < 30% or > 81%, suggesting a “bimodal” distribution (Fig. ​(Fig.2),2), similar to that described by Taiwanese and Dutch research groups [31, 40]. The total dairy cattle population of South Korea is mostly composed of the Holstein breed. In 2015, the dairy cattle population in South Korea was composed of 402,405 bovines, which were kept on 5,407 holdings (approximately 74 dairy cattle per holding) [41]. The highest density of dairy cattle was in Gyeonggi Province, with 15.7 dairy cattle per km2 (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2). The lack of clinical signs of BTV might also be because the development of bluetongue in sheep has attracted little attention in South Korea because of the very small number of domestic sheep. Consequently, most BTV episodes throughout the world may be completely silent. Therefore, the results of the seroepidemiological surveillance performed in this study suggest that subclinical or mild BTV infection of ruminants in South Korea is prevalent almost every year and that there are repeated and recurrent infections among domestic cattle and other ruminants in the affected regions."
341358,3,"Despite the serological evidence of BTV infection and the serotype distribution in dairy cattle, there is no clinical report of bluetongue in any species in South Korea. BTV is apparently still infecting dairy cattle but causing subclinical disease. The factors related to the lack of a routine monitoring system, difficulties in making a clinical diagnosis, and misdiagnoses of similar viral diseases should also not to be ignored. For example, Aino virus, Akabane virus, Chuzan virus, and Ibaraki virus present the greatest difficulty for differential diagnosis because these viral infections cause similar symptoms and have high seropositive rates in sentinel cattle in South Korea, 33.2% for Aino virus, 40.2% for Akabene virus, 29.1% for Chuzan virus, and 7.5% for Ibaraki virus [42]. In the present study, an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.21 was found, indicating that the correlation between two animals within a herd with respect to the BTV result was relatively high. The intra-class correlation coefficient of livestock infectious disease is usually < 0.2 and ranges from 0.04 to 0.42 [43]. This finding indicates that in any particular dairy cattle herd, it is likely that either most dairy cattle in that herd will be serologically positive or most will be negative. Our results revealed a significant association between age and BTV seroprevalence in South Korea, and a similar association was previously reported by several groups studying other cattle populations [44–46]. This association between age class and BTV seropositivity can be explained by a longer time of exposure for adults [46, 47]. The proportion of seropositive animals increased with age, probably resulting more from prolonged exposure of the adults to the vector than to any resistant status of juveniles. BTV infection significantly decreased with the increase in the number of dairy cattle inside a farm. The virus pressure in the vectors and ruminants would decrease due to the dilution effect caused by the increase in the density of susceptible dairy cattle on the farm. Nevertheless, this interesting finding requires further investigation. The results obtained from this study indicate that northern and eastern regions are areas of relatively low BTV seroprevalence. Relative to the factors that affect the likelihood of infection at an individual animal level, living in southern and western regions in South Korea increased the risk of being BTV positive compared with living in northern and eastern areas. This result could partially be explained by the spatial distribution of the Culicoides group, but the association between the BTV epidemiology and Culicoides vector distribution in South Korea is not fully understood."
