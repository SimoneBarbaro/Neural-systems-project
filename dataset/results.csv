1421389,0,"A 49-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of migraines and herpes labialis presented to the emergency department (ED) with headache, and numbness and tingling in the left side of her face and her left leg. She related a history of recurrent sinusitis related to seasonal allergies, but with no recent nasal or pulmonary symptoms. She had developed peri-oral fever blisters, a low-grade fever, and a disabling left temporal headache four weeks earlier. Her headache was unlike the typical migraines that she periodically experienced, which usually responded to a combination of acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. In addition, she experienced nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite in association with her headaches that were accompanied by a 7.7 kg weight loss. She also exhibited personality changes and short-term memory loss. Her blisters healed in two weeks, but her headache and fatigue persisted. She subsequently developed numbness and subjective weakness in the left side of her face and her left leg one week prior to presentation. She sought care from her primary care provider, who diagnosed her with Bell's palsy and prescribed metoclopramide for her nausea. She was also referred to a neurologist who began treatment with aspirin for suspected transient ischemic attack. An MRI of the brain was pending at the time of her presentation to the ED. "
1421389,1," On admission, the patient's temperature was 37.9°C, blood pressure 166/96 mmHg, pulse 89 beats/minute, respiration rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 97.5% on room air. Her mental status and affect were normal. The distribution of dysesthesias was confirmed to be in the V2/V3 and L4/L5 dermatomes on physical examination. No motor deficits, other neurologic abnormalities, or lymphadenopathy were noted. A basic metabolic panel was remarkable for 3.2 mEq potassium/L (normal range 3.5 to 5.0). A complete blood count revealed 11.82 × 109 WBC/L, with 7.304 × 103 absolute lymphocytes/μL. Her CSF was clear and contained 6 WBCs/μL (89% lymphocytes), 63 RBCs/μL, 54 mg glucose/dL, and 49 mg total protein/dL; cell counts were taken from the fourth tube of CSF collected. Results of a chest radiograph were normal, and an MRI scan of the brain showed left greater than right ventriculitis, basal meningitis, and encephalitis of the peri-ventricular and right basal ganglia white matter (see Figure 1). "
1421389,2," Treatment with intravenous dexamethasone, ceftriaxone, and aciclovir was initiated and the low potassium was replaced. The patient's headache and dysesthesias rapidly improved. On day 2, the hospital's pathology lab reported small, mature-appearing lymphocytes and smudge cells in her peripheral blood smear. Further immunological investigation revealed 259 absolute CD4+ T cells (normal range 400 to 1500), 389 absolute CD8+ T cells (normal range 275 to 780), and a CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.7 (normal range 0.9 to 3.7). Results of a CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for HSV-1 were positive, and results of serum HIV-1 and 2 antibody tests were negative. Ceftriaxone and dexamethasone were subsequently discontinued. The serum and CSF studies performed to rule out other infectious and vasculitic processes are listed in Table 1. "
1421389,3," A diagnosis of CLL was confirmed by the expression of CD5, CD19, and CD20 antigens on monoclonal B cells with κ light chain restriction on blood flow cytometry. Fluorescent in situ hybridization later revealed a 13 q deletion, the most common cytogenetic abnormality seen among patients with CLL. The patient's γ-globulin level was 839 mg/dL (normal range 700 to 1600). After eight days on intravenous aciclovir, her symptoms had completely resolved and she was discharged on oral valaciclovir. She remained well for the next few weeks. "
1421389,4," Then, one month after discharge, she developed new bilateral numbness of the hands and feet and was found to have cervical lymphadenopathy on physical examination. A repeat MRI showed increased numbers and size of peri-ventricular lesions (see Figure 1), and she was readmitted. A repeat CSF PCR test for HSV-1 was negative, but 10 oligoclonal bands and a myelin basic protein level of 5.7 ng/mL (normal value <1.5) were found. Table 2 details other laboratory test results for comparison between the patient's first and second admissions. Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed extensive cervical lymphadenopathy, slightly enlarged axillary nodes bilaterally, and early lymphadenopathy among the mesentery. A brain biopsy was performed to rule out CNS lymphoma, and it demonstrated gliosis consistent with MS with no evidence of lymphoma (see Figure 2). She received high-dose parenteral steroids for five days, with symptom resolution occurring within the first two to three days. She was discharged on oral prednisone treatment, to follow up with her neurologist and oncologist. Six months later, the patient was still asymptomatic, having started interferon-β therapy for MS and not yet needing treatment for Rai stage zero CLL. "
653044,0,"Comparison between model estimates and MRI measures The model correctly reproduced local flow direction in all its segments (Fig. 2). Figure 3 shows the comparison between the flow rate measured with PC MRI and the corresponding model estimate. The number of vessels correctly imaged and the p-value of the signed rank test are also reported. We did not measure SSr or SSl flow rates as it was not possible to correctly image these vessels solely in the perpendicular plane. The flow rate measured with MRI was not significantly different from the model estimate for the following veins: IJVr, IJVl, VVr, VVl, ICVr, RVr, RVl, SPSl, SPSr, SRS, posterior part of SSS, TSl, TSr. The flow rates of ISS, ICVl and anterior SSS estimated with the model were statistically different from those measured with MRI. The median flow rate obtained with MRI for anterior SSS (not shown in Fig. 3) and its 95 % CI were 2.5 [1.1–3.1] ml/s, which is statistically different (p<0.0001) from that estimated by the model (7.1 ml/s). "
653044,1," Venous obstruction simulation The structure of the lumped parameter set allowed for separate analysis of the effects of upper and lower circulation anatomical anomalies. As the upper and lower parts of the model were decoupled, changes in the portion above the cardiac level did not affect the one below, and vice versa. "
653044,2," IJV obstruction The intracranial pressure estimated by the model had a specific trend related with the degree of IJV diameter reduction as shown in Fig. 4a. The amplitude depends on the specific node. Figure 4a provides, as an example, the pressure at the confluence of RVs to GV. At this level, intracranial pressure doubled its baseline value when both the IJVs were obstructed, in particular when one of them had a diameter reduction of at least 80 % and the other one of at least 90 %. Fig. 4b shows how the SSS posterior end pressure increases with different IJVs constrictions, with respect to the baseline value, which was removed from each value. The simulations carried out with IJV diameters of 1 cm [29] and 0.7 cm [32] showed intracranial pressure increase for lower IJV diameter reductions. At the level of the RVs confluence to GV, pressure doubled its baseline value for bilateral IJVs obstruction of 70 % in the latter and 60 % in the former (Additional files 2 and 3) case. In regards to the IJV upstream pressure, it doubled its initial value for IJV diameter reduction of at least 20 %. When the total occlusion of one IJV was simulated, retrograde flow in the corresponding SS was computed whenever a partial diameter reduction of the other IJV was modeled. The simulation of bilateral IJV occlusion greater than 90 % produced retrograde flow in the CS, IPS (Fig. 5b) and SPS. The simulations carried out with IJV diameters of 1 cm [29] and 0.7 cm [32] showed reflux of intracranial vessels for lower percentage of bilateral IJV diameter reduction (80 % in the former and of 70 % in the latter case). The results obtained with IJV collaterals differed from those obtained without collaterals by less than 3.5 %. The reflux was observed in the same vessels as without collaterals. "
653044,3," Vertebral vein obstruction The simulation of VV diameter reduction showed an increase in global high pressure in the cervical and vertebral areas, with higher values for severe VVs obstruction. Conversely, the intracranial area was less affected, where the pressure increases by less than 14 %. The CPa and CPp upstream, respectively the confluences of the BP and the OS to the cervical and vertebral areas, were highly affected by VV obstruction. Retrograde flow in POS, POSl and POSr was observed for bilateral VV occlusion higher than 60 %. "
653044,4," Azygos obstruction The obstruction of the proximal azygos segments caused a pressure increment along the azygos. The pressure progressively increased as the azygos diameter was reduced. The obstruction effect was higher for the nodes near to the obstruction itself and lower for the distal parts. We reported (Fig. 6a) the pressure between AZY4 and AZY5, and AZY5 and AZY6 as representative of the former, and the one between AZY11 and AZY12 for the latter. Retrograde flows were computed in the azygos itself and in the thoracic plexus: the higher the degree of diameter reduction, the higher the number of distal azygos and thoracic plexus segments affected by the reflux. Figure 6b shows the flow rate trend with progressive azygos diameter reduction for AZY1, AZY5, and AZY11, as representative of segments from proximal to distal azygos. "
653044,5," EchoColor Doppler results ECD data of MS patients showed IJV abnormalities caused by stenosis, membranous obstruction or hypoplasia in 86 % of cases. Among the stenotic or hypoplastic cases, unilateral IJV occlusion was detected in 28 patients (21 of them had unilateral IJV but not VV occlusion), while bilateral in 37 (17 without VV occlusions). Intracranial reflux was observed in 21/28 subjects with monolateral IJV occlusion (17/21 considering those without VV occlusions), in 28/37 subjects with bilateral IJV occlusion (15/17 considering those without VV occlusions). The reflux was always located in CS, IPS and SPS, but never located in the RV. "
654927,0,"Table 2 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients participating in the PREMiSe study. In total, 15 patients signed an informed consent in phase 1 and 30 in phase 2 after prescreening qualification procedures were completed. Of those, 5 in phase 1 and 10 in phase 2 did not fulfill noninvasive screening procedure requirements on DS. Therefore, 10 patients in phase 1 and 20 in phase 2 were enrolled in the invasive screening portion of the PREMiSe study. All noninvasive and invasive study procedures were well-tolerated. No intra- or postprocedural complications, including vessel rupture, thrombosis side effects to the contrast media or mortality were recorded at 24 hours or 1 month. "
654927,1," Frequency of venous abnormalities on noninvasive and invasive imaging techniques in phase 2 of the PREMiSe All 20 patients fulfilled DS screening criteria that showed anomalies in their IJVs and/or VVs (Figure 1). Of those, one patient did not fulfill invasive screening criteria for endovascular intervention (venous lumen diameter reduction ≥50%). In particular, 19 (95%) patients showed venous abnormality of the right and 19 (95%) of the left IJV, whereas there were 7 (35%) patients who showed venous abnormality of the VVs. The MRV venous abnormalities were found in 7 (35%) of the right and 7 (35%) of the left IJVs and in 3 (15%) of the VVs (Figure 2). Seventeen (85%) patients showed the presence of collateral neck veins on MRV in the right and 15 (75%) on the left side, both on TOF and TRICKS. There were a total of 2.3 (SD 1.2, range 0–4) collateral neck veins on TOF and 2.3 (SD 1.2, range 0–4) on TRICKS. Eleven (55%) patients showed venous abnormality on CV of the right IJV, 14 (73.6%) of the left IJV and 10 (50%) of the azygos veins (Figure 3). Of all stenotic lesions detected by CV in the right IJVs, 11 (100%) were in the lower segment (J3) and 3 (30%) were in the upper segment (J1 or J2), whereas in the left IJVs, 11 (78.6%) of the 14 stenotic veins had lesions detected in the lower segment (J3) and 10 (76.9%) in the upper segment (J1 or J2). The stenotic segment in the azygos vein was in the same location (descending part of the azygos vein distal to the azygos arch). Two of the 20 (10%) left IJVs were not examined by IVUS and one (10%) by CV because of the difficulty to access with the wire. Only 13 of the 14 cases who showed venous abnormality in the left IJV were considered for comparison between CV and IVUS, as one case overlapped with one of the 2 cases who did not get examined with IVUS. Epidural collateral veins were found in 14 (70%) right and 16 (88.9%) left IJVs and in 16 (80%) of the azygos veins. Other collaterals were less common. In total, 10 (50%) right and 15 (83.3%) left IJVs and 17 (85%) azygos veins, demonstrated an IVUS abnormality (Figure 4). The stenosis on IVUS was detected in 7 (35%) right and 11 (61%) left IJVs and in 8 (40%) azygos veins. Reduced respiratory pulsatility was observed in 7 (35%) right and 10 (55.5%) left IJVs and in 7 (35%) azygos veins. Intraluminal abnormalities (septa, vein divided into multiple channels, IHFD and DPL) were detected in all vessels. "
654927,2," Sensitivity and specificity analyses between noninvasive and invasive venous abnormality findings in phase 2 of the PREMiSe study Table 3 shows sensitivity analyses of noninvasive and invasive imaging techniques vs. DS (as a ""gold standard/benchmark"") for the detection of abnormal findings in the IJVs and in azygos vein/VVs. The sensitivity of CV + IVUS was 68.4% for the right and 100% for the left IJV, compared to venous anomalies detected on DS. The sensitivity of IVUS to detect venous anomalies in azygos vein/VVs was high when compared to DS (85.7%). Table 4 shows the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and OR of noninvasive and invasive imaging techniques vs. MRV as the ""gold standard/benchmark"" for the detection of abnormal findings in the IJVs and in azygos vein/VVs. Compared to the venous anomalies detected on MRV, the sensitivity for the detection of venous abnormalities on CV + IVUS was 71.4% in the right and 100% in left IJVs and 100% in azygos but the specificity was 38.5%, 38.9% and 11.8%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and OR of IVUS vs. CV as the ""gold standard/benchmark"" for the detection of abnormal findings in the IJVs and in azygos vein/VVs is shown in Table 5. The sensitivity of IVUS ranged from 72.7% for right IJV to 90% for the azygos vein, although the IVUS showed a higher rate of venous anomalies than CV. Table 6 shows the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and OR of invasive imaging techniques vs. DS + MRV combined as the ""gold standard/benchmark"" for the detection of abnormal findings in the IJVs and in azygos vein/VVs. Again, because the inclusion criteria for the study were having a presence of ≥2 VH extracranial criteria, we were able to derive only sensitivity findings. The sensitivity for the detection of venous anomalies using invasive imaging techniques did not increase compared to DS + MRV. "
432103,0,"Co-incubation of A. polyphaga and M. ulcerans results in intracellular bacilli frequently, Using light microscopy, AFB were observed co-localizing with amoebae after co-incubation of each M. ulcerans strain with A. polyphaga for 3 hours (Figure 2). Electron microscopy was used to confirm the intracellular localization (Figure 3). The bacilli were seen in phagocytic vacuoles with the phagosomal membrane tightly opposed to the bacillary surface (tight phagosomes) (Figure 3D) or, inside ‘‘spacious vacuoles’’ (Figure 3C). The phagosomes contained single (Figure 3C and D) or groups of bacilli (not shown). About 45% of the bacilli in the electron micrographs looked normal according to the parameters previously defined [47], including the presence of an asymmetric profile of the cytoplasmic membrane with the outer layer thicker and denser than the inner layer (Figure 3B). As is typical of the ultrastructure of normal mycobacterial cell envelopes [48], an electron-transparent layer of the cell wall of M. ulcerans was observed (Figure 3B). No electron-transparent zone [49] was seen around the intracellular bacilli (Figure 3). Figure 4 shows that viable M. ulcerans persisted within A. polyphaga for the duration of the experiment (two weeks) although their numbers decreased with 1 to 2 log. "
432103,1," Distribution of amoebae in natural water bodies in Ghana 181 amoeba cultures were obtained from 134 out of 148 collected samples (90.5%). The isolation frequency of amoebae did not differ significantly between BU endemic and non-endemic sites (p = 0.954, x2 1 = 0.004). Different habitats yielded different frequencies of amoeba isolation (p = 0.044, x2 3 = 8.084), with the highest detection frequency in detritus (97.8% vs. 76.9% in water, and 88.9% in biofilms). There was no significant difference between the sampled water bodies (estimated effect: 0.03; 95% CI: 20.19 to 0.24). Because 15 of the 181 amoeba cultures did not survive transportation and/or storage, mycobacteria were only searched for in the remaining 166 amoeba cultures (isolated from 124 different samples). "
432103,2," Detection of M. ulcerans in samples and amoeba cultures IS2404 was detected by real-time PCR in 3 out of 148 samples, after extracting the DNA directly from these samples. In only one of them IS2606 and KR-B were also detected, strongly suggesting the presence of M. ulcerans in that sample (Table 1). The D CT (IS2606 - IS2404) value of 1.96 approaches the known fold difference in copy numbers between IS2404 and IS2606 for M. ulcerans, i.e. 2.3 [44]. However, the high CT values in all 3 of the positive assays (Table 1) imply the presence of less than a genome in the 1 mL DNA extract added to the PCR-mixture so that the D CT’s cannot be considered as true representations of the relative copy numbers of the repeated sequences. Therefore in the two IS2404 positive yet IS2606 and KR-B negative samples the presence of M. ulcerans cannot be denied nor confirmed. Out of the 166 amoeba cultures tested (originating from 124 different samples), seven were positive for IS2404 (Table 1). Again, given the high CT values (Table 1), also here less than a genome was present in the 1 mL of DNA extract added to the PCR mixture. The IS2404 positive amoeba cultures were isolated from BU endemic as well as BU non-endemic communities and from the IS2404-containing different microbial habitats. None of amoeba cultures tested positive for IS2606 or KR-B. However, because of the low mycobacterial DNA content neither the absence or presence of M. ulcerans can be confirmed. None of IS2404 positive amoeba cultures were isolated from samples that had already been found positive for IS2404 in DNA extracted directly from the samples. The following amoebae were identified among the IS2404 positive cultures: Vahlkampfia avara (99% identical with the V. avara sequence in Genbank), a close relative of V. inornata (92% identical with the V. lenticulata (T5 genotype), Acanthamoeba sp. T11 genotype and Acanthamoeba spp. T4 genotype. One of that supposedly supported an amoeba culture did not contain amoebae at the time of IS2404 detection. inornata sequence in Genbank), A. the IS2404 positive agar plates Identification of the IS2404 negative amoebae will be detailed in a subsequent study by Amissah et al. (in preparation). The geographical origins of the IS2404 positive samples and amoeba cultures did not show any distribution pattern. We detected IS2404 in at least 1 sample and/or amoeba culture from all sampled localities, except Bebuso. "
432103,3," Mycobacteria are commonly found intracellularly in the environment and are often detected in amoeba cultures As described in the methods section, subsamples were made to cultivate extracellular and intracellular mycobacteria. Twenty-six of the 148 samples were excluded from further analysis due to contamination of one or both of the subsamples. From 15 samples (12.2%) only intracellular mycobacteria were isolated, from 17 samples (13.9%) only extracellular mycobacteria, and from 32 samples (26.2%) both intra- and extracellular mycobacteria were isolated. Details are given in Table 2. In general the difference between the isolation frequency of extracellular and intracellular mycobacteria was not significant (x2 1 = 0.17, p = 0.89). To assess whether the intracellular life style was more frequent in certain sites or certain habitats, we determined the relative isolation frequency of intracellular mycobacteria (i.e. the number of samples from which intracellular mycobacteria were cultivated divided by the total number of samples from which we cultivated mycobac- teria –intracellular and/or extracellular), and related this to BU endemicity, sampling sites and habitat type. The relative isolation frequency of intracellular mycobacteria did not differ between BU endemic and non-BU endemic areas (0.77 vs. 0.68; p = 0.86, x2 1 = 0.03). The type of habitat, however, did have a significant effect on the relative occurrence of intracellular mycobacteria (p = 0.002; x2 intracellular mycobacteria were more frequently isolated from detritus (relative isolation frequency of 0.95) than from biofilm samples (relative isolation frequency of 0.63; p = 0.01). 3 = 15.1): samples Based on a 821 to 837 bp portion of their 16S-rRNA gene sequence, 76 isolated mycobacteria (of intra- and extracellular origin) could be identified to the species level, with their sequence .99% identical to reference strains of which the sequence is present in GenBank. For 27 isolates, 16S rRNA-DNA sequence based identification was not possible due to the presence of a mixture of different species in the culture. An overview of the identified mycobacterial isolates is shown in Table 3 and Table S1. Species diversity did not show a marked difference between any type of isolation source (Table 3, S1). Mycobacterial 16S-rRNA-DNA was detected in 29 amoeba cultures (17.5%), isolated from 25 out of 124 samples (20.2%). Mycobacterial presence was confirmed by microscopy in 13 of these positive cultures; 1 to 100 AFB were detected per 100 fields, which approximates to orders of 103 to 105 bacilli per culture of amoebae. No AFB were observed co-localising with the amoebae, however. "
2442696,0,"Clinical and demographic data Of the 180 enrolled patients, 173 subjects were eligible for statistical analysis (89 RR-MS and 84 PP-MS) of which 4 RR patients were excluded because of carotid atherosclerosis (1 man) and unavailable transtemporal bone windows (1 man and 2 women), while 1 PP woman abandoned the study because of a previously undiagnosed thyroid enlargement. 82 age and sex matched HCs were selected from general population according to exclusion criteria. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the enrolled groups are showed in table 1. No age and sex differences were found in any of the control or disease groups. Mean basal arterial pressure and beat-rate (in clinostatism) were similar in both groups. 64 of the 85 RR-MS and 18 of the 83 PP-MS patients were on disease-modifying therapy. "
2442696,1," Arterial and Venous blood volume flow A significant asymmetry of the venous CSA (>50%) in supine position were observed in 19 (22.3%) RR-MS, 17 (20.2%) PP-MS patients and 16 (19.5%) HCs with prevalent reduction of left IJV diameter. A negative ΔCSA value was observed in 3 (3.5%) RR-MS, 1 PP-MS (1.2%) and 3 (3.6%) controls. Mean global CBF and CVF values in clinostatism are showed in table 2. The slight reduction of both global CBF and mean total CVF resulted no statistically significant. ΔCVF was negative in 108/173 MS patients (62.4%) and 11/82 (13.4%) HCs (p<0.001). According to clinical phenotype, ΔCVF was negative in 45/85 (52.9%) RR-MS and 63/83 (75.9%) PP-MS (p = 0.01) (figure 1). Age and sex-related differences of CBF, CFV and ΔCVF were not statistically significant. There were no significant correlation among negative ΔCVF and significant asymmetry of venous CSA or negative ΔCSA value. A significantly higher prevalence of negative ΔCVF was observed in EDSS>5 subgroup (42/50, 84%) than in EDSS<5 subgroup (66/118, 55.9%) (p<0.01). "
2442696,2," Intracranial haemodynamic parameters Mean values of PSVs, EDVs and MFVs on TCD examination were similar in all examined arteries between groups (table 3). Postural variations of MFVs in both MCAs were reported in table 4. In sitting position, mean values of MFVs on both MCAs were significantly reduced in RR-MS and PP-MS patients than in control either after 90 s or after 2 min. No significant differences were observed according to age, sex and disease duration. Mean MFV values after 90 s of sitting position were prevalently reduced in patients with EDSS ≥5 than in patients with EDSS<5 (48.3±2 cm/s vs. 54.6±3 cm/s, p = 0.01). BHI values were similar among three groups (RR-MS: 0.88±0.2; PP-MS = 0.86±0.4; HC: 0.88±0.3; p = 0.892). Postural variation of MAP and CPP was reported in table 5. No significant differences in MAP and non-invasive CPP were observed within and between group. Single cerebral veins were inconstantly detected by means of TCDS among subjects without differences between patients and controls and the relative percentages are reported in table 6. Significant reflux was not found in patients or controls and velocity values were within a normal range in all study groups. "
1150,0,"Distribution of suitable habitat, and its relationship to Buruli ulcer In Akonolinga there was a significantly positive correl- ation between Buruli ulcer prevalence and average habi- tat suitability, for both Naucoridae and Belostomatidae, in the wet season (Table 2, Figure 4). This relationship was significant at multiple buffer distances. In contrast, in Bankim there was no significant correlation between Buruli ulcer prevalence and Belostomatidae or Naucoridae average habitat suitability, in either wet or dry seasons or at any buffer distance (Table 3). "
1150,1," Ecologically important variables in the distribution of the aquatic insect families Variable importance was evaluated using Jackknife vari- able removal. Jacknife removes a variable and evaluates the effect of variable removal on the model. In the dry season Belostomatidae and Naucoridae responded in broadly similar fashions; the variable whose removal had the largest effect was GLC 5 km (Figure 5). The land cover categories most suitable for both Belostomatidae and Naucoridae are water bodies, artificial areas, rain fed croplands and forest/grassland mosaics (Figure 6). If one of these categories is the dominant category in 5 km ra- dius, in the dry season, the likelihood of encountering the insect is higher. Unsuitable categories were forest and vegetation/cropland mosaic. In the wet season precipitation is more important than land cover. Precipitation suitability peaks at approxi- mately 300 millimeters per month, and diminishes above or below this (Figure 6). For the dry season there is a simple increase in habitat suitability with increasing precipitation. Flow accumulation had a negative association with habitat suitability, and wetness index had a positive asso- ciation, regardless of season, for both Belostomatidae and Naucoridae. "
1150,2," Model performance AICc for Naucoridae adults (dry season) was 14.6, and 14.2 in the wet season, as in Table 2. For Belostomatidae adults (dry season) the AICc was 12.5, and 12.2 in the wet season. Scores of overfitting are relative; these scores indicate the Belostomatidae model was less prone to overfitting than the Naucoridae model. The AG data set was also used in model validation. In the dry season Naucoridae adults had an AG AUC of 0.83, and 0.80 in the wet season. Belostomatidae adults had an AG AUC of 0.80 in the dry season, and 0.86 in the wet season. These scores indicate that the models are able to describe the distribution of the insects with good accuracy; the model based on SME dataset is able to accurately replicate the independently collected AG dataset. "
1287608,0,"Protocol Table 3 provides an overview of data collection and analysis from MRI scans. PC-VIPR scans were successfully performed and analyzed for 163/172 (94.8%) of all subjects in the head, 155/172 (90.1%) in the neck, and 146/172 (88.9%) in the AV. The main reason for acquisition or analysis failure was due to data archiving problems (head—n = 5; neck—n = 7; AV—n = 9). CE-MRV of the neck was successfully scanned and scored in 97.3% of cases, while that of the chest was slightly lower at 96.1%. CCSVI US scans were successfully performed in all subjects the same day the MRI exam was performed. "
1287608,1," MRI flow analysis Figure 2 displays group-wise bar plot results of total flow and %RF across all vessels measured using PC-VIPR. No major differences are observed for any flow parameter or in any vessel between groups. No statistically significant differences were observed for any flow parameter (total flow, peak flow, or %RF) across all vessels and between all combinations of groups. Likewise, no statistically significant differences were observed between age- and sex-matched pairs. "
1287608,2," CE-MRV analysis Good IJV image quality scores were observed (all subjects averaged: reader 1 = 3.3 ± 0.7, reader 2 = 2.8 ± 0.5), with moderate inter-rater reliability in morphology scores (κ = 0.56). For dichotomized IJV scoring, inter-rater reliability was greater (κ = 0.60). For the AV in the chest, image quality scores were good (all subjects averaged: reader 1 = 3.2 ± 0.9, reader 2 = 2.7 ± 0.5), yet inter-rater reliability in morphology scores was poor (κ = 0.16). Despite variable inter-rater reliability scores, no statistically significant differences between any group combinations were observed for CE-MRV morphology measurements, for either reader. "
1287608,3," MRI flow and US assessment Subjects with %RF > 5% in any part of the MRI regional flow assessment (head, IJVs, AV) were considered to exhibit “CCVSI-like” criteria. The percentage of total subjects showing this feature was compared to the percentage of subjects with ≥ 2 US CCSVI criteria and is shown in Table 4.

1128341,0,"Genome sequence comparisons of 179 M. ulcerans isolates from Central Africa. To understand the dynamics and timing of the spread of M. ulcerans across Central Africa, we sequenced the genomes of 179 clinical isolates that were obtained between 1962 and 2014 and spanned most of the known areas of BU endemicity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Republic of the Congo, and Angola (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). To prevent mapping the obtained sequence reads to a reference that diverged signiﬁcantly from these isolates, we assembled a new, complete closed DRC M. ulcerans reference chromosome using PacBio reads. This reference chromosome received the strain name SGL03 (for Songololo territory 2003). SGL03 comprises a single 5,625,184-bp (6,422 bp smaller than the Ghanaian reference chromosome Agy99) circular bacterial chromosome with a G⫹C content of 65.5%. Whole-genome comparisons between SGL03 and Agy99 revealed exten- sive synteny and collinearity. However, a total of 12 large (⬎100 bp) indels were identiﬁed between SGL03 and Agy99 (see Table S2). Most indel events were mediated by copies of insertion (IS) elements IS2404 and IS2606; these either ﬂanked deletions or they were present in the deleted or substituted sequence stretches. Well represented in the deleted sequences were pseudogenes that either contained frameshift mutations or were disrupted by IS elements. Illumina sequence reads of the sample panel were aligned to the newly assembled SGL03 chromosome and, after removing any diversity detected in repetitive IS elements and ignoring small indel polymorphisms, we found 6,655 single nucleotide polymor- phisms (SNPs) uniformly distributed along the bacterial chromosome, which amounts to 1 SNP per 846 bp (see Fig. S2). A total of 161 clones (unique genomes) were discerned among the isolate panel. A Bayesian time-measured phylogeny was inferred from a whole-genome alignment of the isolates (Fig. 1). Both known lineages of African M. ulcerans were identiﬁed within the Central African isolate panel: 178/179 (99.4%) corresponded to lineage Mu_A1 and 1/179 (0.6%) corresponded to the uncommon lineage Mu_A2. The average pairwise SNP difference (SNPΔ) between Mu_A1 Central African isolates was low (59 SNPs, standard deviation [SD] ⫽ 42), as the majority of the discovered diversity derived from the relatively large genetic distance (5,270 SNPs, SD ⫽ 7) between Mu_A1 and the single Mu_A2 isolate from the region. The Mu_A2 isolate (ITM130340) originated from a patient (female [F], 40 years old) from the hamlet Kilima in the Songololo territory (Nkamuna health area) (see Fig. S4). We were unable to retrospectively interview the patient to identify any travel history or activity that could explain the unexpected Mu_A2 distribution. "
1128341,1," Phylogenetic analysis reveals strong geographical restrictions on M. ulcerans dispersal at high-level geographical scales. Within an M. ulcerans phylogeny of the entire African continent (see Fig. S3), the single Songololo Mu_A2 isolate clustered together with a clade of 8 other Mu_A2 isolates originating from Benin, Gabon, and Cameroon. Furthermore, a distinct Mu_A1 isolate from The Republic of the Congo (ITM_071925) clustered together with a small clade of Nigerian and Cameroonian M. ulcerans isolates. More importantly, however, all other 177 Mu_A1 isolates of the Central African panel formed a monophyletic group within that continental African phylogeny. There was distinct spatial clustering of M. ulcerans from the different endemic BU foci within the phylogeny. For instance, all 123 isolates of the endemic BU focus of the Songololo territory formed a strongly supported monophyletic group (Fig. 2). The Songololo territory isolates had an average pairwise SNPΔ of 46 (SD ⫽ 18) and were unrelated to the four isolates from the neighboring Tshela territory (north- west in the Kongo Central province) that formed a separate monophyletic group (Fig. 2). We cannot identify a speciﬁc historic geographical route that these bacterial lineages followed, but the phylogenetic evidence clearly links these separate clonal expansions as a single epidemic. "
1128341,2," The clustering of M. ulcerans genotypes ends at ﬁne geographical scales. We then explored the geographical distribution of M. ulcerans genotypes at a ﬁner geographical scale: that of the Songololo territory. The 123 Songololo isolates originating from 123 individual patients were spread evenly over the territory, and the majority of health areas with a “modest” to “high” BU burden were well represented (Fig. S4). Bayesian model-based inference of the genetic population structure revealed the existence of six groups (designated BAPS groups 1 to 6) within the territory (Fig. 3). The six groups generally cooccurred, as in some regions of the territory, multiple groups were found to be circulating simultaneously. In the health area of Lovo for instance, up to ﬁve different groups were cocirculating (BAPS 1 to 5). The groups were, however, distrib- uted differently over the study region: groups 2, 4, and 5 were found widely dispersed, while groups 1, 3, and 6 were more restricted (Fig. 3). Group 1 (n ⫽ 20) was found almost exclusively in the eastern Kimpese health area, while group 3 (n ⫽ 31) was localized in the western Nsona-Pangu health area (see Fig. S5). Group 6 was uncommon (n ⫽ 4) and found solely in the southwest. Within groups, there were some distinct subgroups, which very occasionally also had a limited distribution across the region. For example, one speciﬁc subgroup of BAPS group 2 consisted of seven isolates that all originated from a 90-km2 zone covering the neighboring health areas of Mukimbungu and Kasi (Fig. S5). However, other subgroups were far more broadly distributed, with the extreme example of identical genomes identiﬁed in different BU patients separated by larger distances (Fig. 3, I to X). A total of ten such genomes that were identiﬁed multiple times in the Songololo territory were discerned (Table 1). The average geo- graphical distance between the domiciles of patients identiﬁed with isolates with identical genomes was 17.3 ⫾ 18.1 km. "
1128341,3," The Central African mutation rate of M. ulcerans is similar to that inferred on a continental scale. We derived a timed phylogeny of Central African M. ulcerans while simultaneously inferring mutation rates and dates of divergence of key M. ulcerans clades (Fig. 1). In this process, a molecular clock was estimated using correlations between phylogenetic divergence and isolation times of heterochronous disease iso- lates. As a result, a mean genome wide substitution rate of 4.38E⫺8 per site per year (95% highest posterior density [HPD] interval, 2.83E⫺8 to 6.03E⫺8]) was demonstrated, which corresponds to an accumulation rate of 0.23 SNPs per bacterial chromosome per year (95% HPD interval, 0.15 to 0.32). The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis indicates that lineage Mu_A1 had been intro- duced in Central Africa multiple hundreds of years ago (tMCRA [Mu_A1], 1372; 95% HPD, 913 to 1776), while the timing of the BU introduction event in the Songololo territory was estimated at around 1865 (95% HPD, 1803 to 1915) (Fig. 1). Finally, the time tree also indicates that the separated “eastern” (tMCRA [BAPS-1], 1941; 95% HPD, 1908 to 1969) and “western” (tMCRA [BAPS-3], 1922; 95% HPD, 1885 to 1954) Songololo groups have most likely remained segregated over a timespan of half a century. "
1128341,4," Demographic history of M. ulcerans in the Songololo territory. The reconstruc- tion of the demographic history of M. ulcerans in the Songololo territory involved the coestimation of its time tree, the mycobacterial population size at different points along the timescale of that phylogeny, and all other parameters of the employed model of molecular evolution. Consequently, the resulting plot of the population history includes credibility intervals that represent the combined phylogenetic and coalescent uncer- tainties. An inspection of the extended Bayesian skyline plot (EBSP) (Fig. 4) indicated that the M. ulcerans population size remained stable until the early 1980s, after which it increased slightly during the course of the 1990s, until it reached a peak around 2004. This was followed by a small decline that persisted until 2014. We identiﬁed temporal parallels between the observed past population dynamics of M. ulcerans from the Songololo territory and the timing of health policy changes managing the BU epidemic in that region (Fig. 4), though we need to recognize overlap in credibility intervals surrounding the estimates during these periods. We checked for factors that might bias the reconstruction of the mycobacterial population size over time by conducting extensive resampling and randomization experiments (see Fig. S6). "
432129,0,"Distribution of M. ulcerans in aquatic ecosystems. MU was broadly distributed within both regions, and was found at least once in more than 80% of sites sampled during the year, with different distribution patterns for each region (Figure 1). In Akonolinga, MU was detected in all sites at least once during the year regardless of the geographical location or the type of ecosystem sampled. MU distribution in Bankim was more restricted, with 4 out of 16 sites found negative all year long, notably from streams in the northern part of the region. Overall, the proportion of positive sample-pools (hereafter defined as ‘‘pool positivity’’ or ‘‘pool prevalence’’) ranged from 0 to 25% in the different sites, with the highest rates distributed along the road in the southern part of Bankim between the Mape´ Dam and the Mbam River, and close to the basin of the Nyong river in Akonolinga (in swamps and streams nearby). Aquatic ecosystems with stagnant waters appeared to be associated with higher MU presence (Figure 2). We found MU in aquatic organisms from all four types of aquatic ecosystems sampled, with an average of 7.7% of positive sample-pools across ecosystems. Overall, positivity rate was 4.9% in rivers, 4.6% in flooded areas, 10.0% in swamps and 6.2% in streams. We found that swamps had significantly higher positivity than all other ecosystems in Bankim, with positivity in swamps 3 and 5 times higher than in streams and flooded areas respectively (x2 test, p-value ,0.0001 for both). However, no significant differences in MU presence were found for any given environment in Akonolinga, although positivity in flooded areas and swamps was slightly higher. "
432129,1," Distribution of M. ulcerans in the aquatic community. A total number of 238,496 individuals were collected and classified over the course of the study, 200,918 in Akonolinga and 37,578 in Bankim. According to the pooling strategy described above, 145,255 of those (61%) were distributed in 3,084 sample-pools and analyzed by qPCR. 65 distinctive taxa were identified (Table S1). 85% of the whole aquatic community overall was made up of only 5 taxonomic orders: Coleoptera, Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Hemiptera (Table 1). Among these, the most abundant families were Baetidae (18%), Noteridae (12%), Chiron- omidae (11%) and Hydrophilidae (7%). Aquatic vertebrates (fishes, tadpoles) and semi-aquatic or terrestrial orders (Araneae, Lepidop- tera larvae, Collembola) represented 4% and 2%, respectively. Among aquatic ecosystems, water bodies with standing and slow flowing waters had less biodiversity in terms of number of orders, and were dominated by the 5 most abundant orders mentioned above (Table S2). Conversely, streams had higher biodiversity, with a larger proportion of other groups such as Decapoda and Trichoptera. MU was present in nearly all taxonomic groups of the aquatic community and it was approximately evenly distributed among the whole aquatic community (Table 2). Pool prevalence for most of the groups was between 5–15%. Larvae of the order Lepidoptera had the highest pool prevalence overall (13.6%), followed by Annelida (12.3%) and Hemiptera (11.4%). However, regional differences in MU distribution should be noted: most of positive Lepidoptera and Annelida came from Bankim, where positivity was nearly 3 times higher for both groups than in Akonolinga (20.8 and 17.7% in Bankim compared to 5.0 and 6.7% in Akonolinga, respectively), although these differences were not significant. The lowest pool prevalence among positive groups was found in Acari (2.8%), Mollusca (3.3%) and Araneae (5.6%). Finally, we failed to detect MU only in two taxonomic groups: Trichoptera (89 pools tested, 1,434 individuals) and Collembola (28 pools tested, 79 individuals). "
432129,2," Monthly fluctuations of M. ulcerans presence in aquatic ecosystems. MU was present in aquatic ecosystems nearly all year long. In Akonolinga, where samples were collected every month, MU was only absent in May, and in Bankim we detected MU in all four time steps sampled (every three months). In this section, only the dynamics for the 12 months in Akonolinga are shown (Figures S1 and S2 show the dynamics in Bankim). MU presence fluctuated through time (Figure 3), with changes from 0 to 15% in total pool positivity. The largest peak in pool positivity was found in August and October, and we found a progressive drop in pool positivity from October to February. Each ecosystem had distinct temporal variations and a favorable time of the year for MU presence (Figure 3). In rivers and flooded areas, MU was absent for a long period of time (4 and 8 months respectively) and then experienced a sudden increase in pool positivity (in April and July respectively). As a result, more than half of positive sample-pools in these ecosystems were found in a specific season, the low rainy season for rivers and the low dry season for flooded areas (Figure 4). In swamps and streams, the seasonal effect was less pronounced with presence of MU most of the year and fluctuations in pool positivity that ranged from 0 to 15% for swamps and to 30% in streams. Over one third of positive sample-pools in swamps and streams were found during the low rainy season and around one third were found in another season (high dry season for swamps and low dry season for streams). Of all ecosystems, only MU positivity dynamics for rivers were correlated to rainfall dynamics (Figure S5). "
432129,3," Temporal dynamics of M. ulcerans presence in the aquatic community. MU colonization dynamics for the different taxonomic groups were highly variable (Figure 5). Hemipterans were the only group positive during 11 months of the year, whereas the order Coleoptera was repeatedly negative for more than half a year (from November to May). The highest peaks in pool positivity at any given month were for Hemiptera in June (.30%) and for Diptera in August (25%). Pool positivity in other orders was lower than 20% all year long. Out of the 5 orders systematically tested for all sites and months for MU presence, none of their colonization dynamics were correlated to rainfall (Figure S6). "
432234,0,"Comparison of a mycolactone-based enoyl reductase (ER) PCR target to an IS2404 PCR target for detection of M. ulcerans IS2404 PCR has been widely used for detection of M. ulcerans in the environment and patients because of the high copy number of the IS element (213) within the M. ulcerans genome [28] However, evidence from the M. ulcerans genome as well as results from length polymorphisms of IS2404 suggests restriction fragment considerable heterogeneity between copies, as well as the presence of incomplete copies which could lead to production of multiple products [29]. For this reason we developed a PCR method based on amplification of the ER domain of mlsA which encodes a polyketide synthase that produces the mycolactone core, and compared the sensitivity of ER PCR and IS2404 PCR using environmental samples, as well as M. ulcerans cultures. M. ulcerans in Aquatic Environments in Ghana In this study 319 invertebrate and vertebrate samples were analyzed using IS2404 PCR and the PCR products were sequenced. A PCR product of appropriate size was obtained from eight invertebrate samples. However, DNA sequencing showed that only four of the samples contained IS2404 DNA. Although adjustment of PCR parameters improved specificity somewhat, many non-specific products were still amplified. ER PCR of the initial eight IS2404 positive samples yielded four ER positive samples. DNA sequence results confirmed that all four ER positive samples contained ER sequence. Further analysis of DNA from 71 ER positive samples showed that ER DNA was the product in every case. ER is present four times on the mycolactone plasmid. Although there is no evidence concerning plasmid copy number, most large plasmids are present in only 1 or 2 copies per cell making the copy number for the ER target 4–8 [3]. Because we initially assumed there was a clear correlation between copy number and PCR sensitivity, we were concerned that the lower copy number of the ER domain, with respect to IS2404, might influence the sensitivity of the method. Thus the relative sensitivity of ER and IS2404 PCR was evaluated using 10-fold dilutions of M. ulcerans culture. As few as 1021 CFU of M. ulcerans could be detected using either method (Figure 2). These results suggested that ER PCR was adequately sensitive for detection of M. ulcerans in environmental samples where few copies of M. ulcerans might be present. "
432234,1, ER and VNTR primer sets are sensitive at low concentrations of M. ulcerans DNA Sensitivity of the primer sets targeting VNTR loci and ER for environmental samples was also determined by spiking samples of belostomatids with serial dilutions of M. ulcerans DNA and performing ER and VNTR PCR. Results from this study show that ER and VNTR DNA could be detected at predicted concentrations as low as 0.1 CFU (Figure S2). 
432234,2," ER PCR based evidence of M. ulcerans in environmental samples from endemic and non-endemic villages in Ghana During 2004–2006 1,068 invertebrate and vertebrate samples were collected from 14 endemic and 12 non-endemic sites with a focus on the Ashanti and Greater Accra regions of Ghana (Figure 3). Samples included material collected within 1 m2 quadrats (N = 3) as well as those obtained by sweep sampling through vegetation. Identical sampling methods were used for all sites. Endemic sites yielded more samples than non-endemic sties. Of the 1,068 samples obtained, 572 (54%) were obtained from endemic sites whereas 496 (46%) were from non-endemic sampling sites. M. ulcerans DNA was detected in only 7% (78/ 1,068) of the total samples (Table 4) using ER PCR. From the 78 ER positive samples, 42 (54%) were from aquatic environments endemic for Buruli ulcer; whereas 36 (46%) samples were from non-endemic sites. The largest number of ER positive invertebrate samples was collected from Afuaman where 18 invertebrate pooled or individual samples were found to be positive. Six sites yielded only one ER positive pooled or individual sample. These included three endemic sites (Tontokrom, Bowkrom, and Amasa- man) and three non-endemic sites (Bretsekrom, Dodowa, and Keedmos). Eight sites yielded zero ER positive invertebrate or vertebrate samples (five endemic and three non-endemic). The remaining eleven sites (six non-endemic and five endemic) had a range of 2 to 10 PCR positive pooled or individual invertebrate samples. All ER PCR positive results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. ER positive DNA was detected in a broad spectrum of the 89 taxa vertebrates and invertebrates representing 30 of identified. Many taxa, such as Crambidae (moth) larvae and Araneae were found repeatedly positive at specific sites during the 2 year sampling period. Two pools of Crambidae larvae were found positive from Subin; one collected 2005 and the other collected 2006. Araneae have been found positive from sampling of Amasaman 2004, 2005, and 2006. Although some taxa, such as Belostomatidae and Naucoridae have been found IS2404 positive by others [12,13,14] most ER PCR positive taxa reported in this study have not previously been identified as potential sources of M. ulcerans. M. ulcerans positive taxa represented a wide variety of functional invertebrate feeding groups and life stages (Table 2) [30]. Although most of the positive taxa represented predators, positive results were obtained from collector-gatherers such as those from the family Elmidae (beetle) and scrapers such as those from the family Baetidae (mayfly). A complete description of the demography and identification of positive taxa per site are presented in a separate paper (in preparation). Previous reporting of M. ulcerans in Belostomatidae and Naucoridae led us to selectively collect additional samples from these taxa. Seventy-one additional belostomatids and twenty additional naucorids were obtained through selective collection. Of those, 3/71 (4%) belostomatids and 7/20 (35%) naucorids were found to contain ER positive DNA. Although these results suggest that M. ulcerans DNA is widely distributed in invertebrates, the majority of taxa identified (59/89) were repeatedly negative for M. ulcerans DNA (Table S1). In some cases where a taxon was represented by a single sample, such as with Calonoida (copepod), little can be said about the absence of M. ulcerans. In other cases such as with Coenagrinidae (damselfly M. ulcerans in Aquatic Environments in Ghana larvae) and Pleidae (backswimmer), over 100 individuals were sampled. The absence of ER PCR positive results from these taxa is more meaningful. Out of 260 samples of water filtrate tested (130 from non-endemic and 130 from endemic sampling sites), 97 (36%) were ER PCR positive. Sixty of the 97 ER positive filtrate samples (61%) were from areas non-endemic for Buruli ulcer, while 37 (38%) of the ER positive filtrate samples were from endemic areas. PCR was also conducted on 100 soil samples; 50 of which were from endemic sites and 50 from non-endemic sites. M. ulcerans DNA was detected in 3% (3/100) of the soil samples (Table 4). Each of these three samples was collected from the floor of the water body. Two of the three ER PCR positive soil samples were from an area endemic for Buruli ulcer (Nyame-Bekyere and Subin) while the third was from an area non- endemic for Buruli Ulcer (Abbeypanya). "
432234,3," VNTR analysis reveals heterogeneity with M. ulcerans and distinguishes M. ulcerans from other MPM Although ER PCR is a reasonable preliminary test for the identification of M. ulcerans, the discovery of other mycolactone producing mycobacteria (MPM) in fish and frogs revealed that mycolactone genes are not M. ulcerans specific [26,31]. In order to distinguish between M. ulcerans and other MPM, a VNTR-based method was developed based on published VNTR sequence [23,24,25]. For this analysis, a panel of 6 Ghanaian M. ulcerans isolates obtained from patients in the same regions where the environmental samples were collected was compared to a panel of MPM species. Primers targeting VNTR loci 4, 8, 14, 15, 18, and MIRU 9 did not distinguish between Ghanaian isolates of M. ulcerans and other MPM, although several of these loci had been previously used to discriminate between Beninese M. ulcerans and other MPM [24,25]. Although some studies have found only 1 biovar of M. ulcerans in West Africa suggesting very little heterogeneity among M. ulcerans isolates within Africa [24,25] one paper, which investigated a large group of M. ulcerans isolates from Ghana identified three different biovars [23]. In this paper, VNTR analysis of 6 M. ulcerans isolates from the Greater Accra, Central and Ashanti regions revealed three M. ulcerans VNTR profiles, A, B, and C based on MIRU 1, locus 6 and STI (Table 5). Profile A strains contained one copy of MIRU 1, one copy of locus 6, and one copy of ST1 (1,1,1). Profile B strains had three copies of MIRU 1, one copy of locus 6, and one copy of ST1 (3,1,1) and profile C consisted of a single isolate with three copies of MIRU 1, one copy of locus 6, and two copies of ST1 (3,1,2). Two of these VNTR profiles, B and C, were previously identified by Hilty et al [23] whereas profile A, characterized by a single copy of MIRU 1 and one copy of ST1 represented a new profile. These VNTR loci also distinguished M. ulcerans from other MPM (Table 5). Finally, the addition of locus 19 made it possible to distinguished M. liflandii, a newly discovered frog pathogen, from mycolactone producing fish pathogens M. marinum and M. pseudoshottsii (Table 5). Two separate VNTR profiles were identified among mycolac- tone producing M. marinum isolates and these were associated with different habitats (Table 5). Whereas fish from salt water had profile D, those from freshwater had profile E (Table 5). Profile D included one copy of MIRU1, four copies of locus 6, two copies of ST1, and two copies of locus 19 (1,4,2,2), and profile E had one copy of MIRU1, two copies of locus 6, one copy of ST1, and two copies of locus 19 (1,2,1,2). Despite the great geographical distance between the Red and Mediterranean Seas and the Chesapeake Bay, MPM M. marinum isolated from sea bass (Siganus nivulatus) and M. pseudoshottsii isolated from striped bass (Morone saxatilis) shared identical 1,4,2,2 VNTR profiles. VNTR analysis revealed a single VNTR profile for M. liflandii (1,2,2,1). These results showed that VNTR could be used to differentiate MPM found in environ- mental samples in Ghana. "
432234,4," M. ulcerans and other MPM are present in both Buruli ulcer endemic and non-endemic sites To discriminate between M. ulcerans and other MPM, 78 ER- PCR positive samples collected from standardized sampling and 10 ER positive belostomatids and naucorids (3 belostomatids and 7 naucorids) that were selectively collected were tested for the presence and copy number of MIRU1, locus 6, STL and if applicable, locus 19. Of these samples, VNTR profiles were obtained from 67 invertebrate/vertebrate samples (Table 6). The remaining 31 samples could not be VNTR typed presumably due to insufficient material. VNTR profiling showed that only 12 of these 67 samples (18%) had a VNTR profile which matched M. ulcerans (Table 6). Seven of these were collected from aquatic environments endemic for Buruli ulcer, and five of these were from non-endemic water bodies. M. ulcerans Profile A was identified in 9 different invertebrate species, whereas M. ulcerans profile C, found in the genome sequence strain Agy99 was detected in specimens of a Nepidae (Order Hemiptera), a Belostomatidae and an unidentified spider. VNTR MPM profile D was found in three samples, including a tadpole (Anura) and two predacious aquatic insects (Coleoptera: Families Hydrophilidae and Dytisci- dae, Table 4). M. ulcerans VNTR profile A and MPM profile D was obtained from different samples of Dytiscidae, Anura and Hydrophilidae. Both Anura and Hydrophilidae samples were collected from the same endemic site. The Dytiscidae samples were collected from two different endemic sites. M. ulcerans profiles A and C were identified in two separate Belostomatidae samples collected from separate sites, one endemic and one non-endemic. These results suggest that M. ulcerans and other MPM occupy the same water body. VNTR analysis of 82 ER PCR positive water filtrates yielded 8 M. ulcerans positive samples. One of these was profile B whereas the other 7 typed as profile A. Four of these samples were from non-endemic areas, while the remaining four samples were from endemic areas. Four of the 82 ER PCR positive water filtrates yielded MPM profile E. Two of these were from endemic regions whereas two were from non-endemic sites. The identity of all VNTR products was confirmed by sequence analysis. Represen- tative gels illustrating VNTR profiles from various sample types are given in Figure S1. These data suggest that human endemicity data do not reliably predict the presence of M. ulcerans in Ghana. "
432234,5," Physical evidence consistent with the presence of mycobacteria can be obtained by collection of biofilm communities on glass slides Ninety-six glass slides were submerged in water bodies associated with human use in the communities of Amasaman (endemic) and Adigon, (non-endemic). From these, 47 slides were collected at 21, 42 and 98 days. At 21 days, biofilm formation on slides collected from Adigon was sparse, but became progressively denser over the course of the experiment. In contrast, at Amasaman, the endemic site, biofilms were very dense by 21 days, but became less dense over the course of the study (Figure 4). Acid-fast bacilli were found on 45 of 47 slides (Figure 4). Microscopic analysis of the biofilm community showed the presence of diatoms and fungus as well as a mixed population of bacteria and considerable detritus. Acid-fast bacilli occurred in clusters or small groups, but were not associated with other flora present on the slide consistent with the ability of mycobacteria to adhere to glass [32]. "
432234,6," Adigon (non-endemic) Of the 47 biofilm slides analyzed, 37 were ER PCR positive (Table 4). VNTR profiles of 17 (46%) of these matched M. ulcerans, while 8 matched VNTR profiles of other MPM. VNTR analysis of slides collected from Adigon at 21 days was not conducted because all samples were ER negative (Figure 5). Three of five ER positive slides (60%) collected at 42 days from Adigon had M. ulcerans VNTR profile A, whereas one of the slides had a VNTR profile matching other MPM (profile D). M. ulcerans VNTR profiles were found at Adigon at 98 days although VNTR patterns not matching MPM were found on two slides. One of these corresponded to M. liflandii (profile F) while the other matched that of MPM associated with fish (profile E). "
432234,7," Amasaman (endemic) Nine of the twelve (75%) ER positive slides taken from Amasaman at 21 days had a M. ulcerans VNTR profile matching profile A, whereas a VNTR profile matching that of M. liflandii (profile F) was found on two slides. Five of six (83%) ER positive slides taken at 42 days from Amasaman had M. ulcerans profiles. M. ulcerans was not detected on the slides taken from Amasaman at 98 days although three slides (60%) produced VNTR signatures matching fish-associated MPMs (D and E). These results show the evolution of biofilm communities through time. The absence of M. ulcerans at 98 days is particularly interesting and could be explained by spontaneous detachment of the biofilm, or by grazing by tadpoles or invertebrates. "
432234,8," M. ulcerans DNA is not detected in ER negative environmental samples The analysis of VNTR data from environmental samples is complicated by many factors not present when analysis is performed on a pure bacterial colony. DNA extracted from insects, frogs, fish or filters contains DNA from a complex population of organisms. If VNTR profiling is a valid tool for detection of M. ulcerans in environmental samples, ER negative samples should also be negative for M. ulcerans by VNTR PCR. If however, specific VNTR sequences are present in a number of different organisms, or in bacteria which do not produce mycolactone, VNTR analysis of ER negative sites could yield a M. ulcerans or MPM profile. For example, if 1 repeat of MIRU1, locus 6 and ST1 were present in each of three different bacteria within a single environmental sample, this sample would produce a VNTR profile consistent with M. ulcerans. If this were the case, VNTR analysis of environmental samples would have little value in the identification of M. ulcerans. To address this possibility, VNTR analysis was performed on two sets of ER negative samples. The first set consisted of ER negative DNA from 35 samples representing a broad spectrum of samples collected at many different sites. The second set of samples was a complete sample set of 34 samples from a single ER negative site. Invertebrate, vertebrate, water filtrate, and soil samples were represented in each set. Though some of these samples produced bands for an individual locus, none of these samples produced a M. ulcerans VNTR profile. "
432234,9," Mycobacterium ulcerans and MPM are widely distributed within endemic and non-endemic sites in the Ashanti and Greater Accra regions Twenty-six sites were sampled from 2004–2006 (Table 7). Fourteen were endemic and twelve were non-endemic. These sites represented water bodies from south-central regions in Ghana with a focus on the Greater Accra and the Ashanti regions. All samples from seven sites were ER negative suggesting the absence of any MPM including M. ulcerans. Six sites had samples with DNA insufficient for VNTR analysis. VNTR profiling was performed on the remaining thirteen sites, seven endemic and six non-endemic sites. M. ulcerans profile A was found in 6 of the endemic sites. Three endemic sites had only one VNTR profile: Ampa Abena and Nyame-Bekyere had M. ulcerans profile A, and Subin had MPM profile E. Two or more VNTR profiles were found within the same water body at four of the endemic sites. Bonsaaso was found to contain M. ulcerans VNTR profiles A, B and C. Along with M. ulcerans profile A, Bowkrom and Afuaman also had MPM profiles E and D, respectively. Amasaman was found to contain two M. ulcerans VNTR profiles (A and B), one of the MPM M. marinum VNTR profiles (profile D), and the profile corresponding to M. liflandii (profile F). than endemic sites. Four of Samples from six non-endemic sites produced VNTR profiles. However, there was less diversity of VNTR profiles from the non- endemic sites these sites were represented by one M. ulcerans profile (either profile A or C), and one of the sites, Afienya, had only a MPM M. marinum VNTR profile (profile E). Adigon was the only non-endemic site which yielded multiple VNTR profiles. VNTR profiles of M. ulcerans (profile A), MPM M. marinum (profiles D and E), and M. liflandii (profile F) were all obtained from biofilm samples collected in Adigon. VNTR profiles representing M. ulcerans and other MPMs were obtained from sites from both the Greater Accra and the Ashanti regions (Figure 3). M. ulcerans and MPM VNTR profiles were found within the same site more frequently in the Greater Accra region than in the Ashanti region. M. ulcerans VNTR profiles A, B and C (1,1,1, 3,1,1 and 3,1,2 respectively) were found in both the Greater Accra and the Ashanti regions. MPM M. marinum profile D was found only in the Greater Accra region, whereas profile E was found in both regions. Profile F (M. liflandii) was found in two sites of the Greater Accra region. "
434379,0,"Identification of potential M. ulcerans antigens Forty-seven chromosomally-encoded CDS, potentially unique to M. ulcerans were identified by bioinformatic comparison of the M. ulcerans genome to 21 other mycobacterial genomes (see Materials and Methods for genomes used). We then excluded CDS ,50 codons in length and the insertion sequence elements IS2404 and IS2606 and also applied the following criteria to include only those CDS likely to generate an immune response: i) predicted membrane association; ii) predicted secretion signal; or iii) previously confirmed as expressed in a proteomic study [32], resulting in 34 chromosomal CDS of interest. We also identified 33 unique CDS on the pMUM001 plasmid and in addition we included in our analysis the sequences encoding the 12 unique functional domains of the mycolactone polyketide synthases (MlsA1, MlsA2 & MlsB) as representative of the entire genetic variability present in this locus [9]. Due to the close genetic relationship between M. ulcerans and M. marnium and the knowledge that M. marinum M, does not reflect the genetic diversity in the M. marinum complex [10], 30 genetically diverse M. marinum isolates were tested for the presence of the selected chromosomal CDS by PCR. The M. marinum strains do not contain pMUM plasmids, so these isolates were not tested for the presence of any of the plasmid CDS. Eleven of the CDS identified as M. ulcerans specific by bioinformatic comparisons were found to be present in at least one of the other M. marinum strains tested and were thus excluded from further analyses (Table 1). The pMUM plasmids are known to vary in both size and gene content between M. ulcerans strains [11,33], and so we tested a selection of 26 geographically distinct M. ulcerans isolates, by PCR, for the presence of each of the plasmid sequences (Table 1). Additionally, we examined these strains for the presence of each of the selected chromosomal sequences by PCR, and found that six of the plasmid CDS and four of the chromosomally encoded CDS were present in all of the M. ulcerans strains tested (Table 1). Because the focus of our study is to develop diagnostic reagents for use in African patients where the need for BU control is most urgent, we particularly focused on the distribution of sequences of interest in African isolates of M. ulcerans. The 23 M. ulcerans specific chromosomal CDS were found in all 10 of the African M. ulcerans strains the plasmid-borne mycolactone polyketide synthase (mls) sequences were found in all M. ulcerans strains tested, and also 32 of 33 non-mls plasmid sequences were present in all African strains. MUP038 was absent by PCR from a single African strain (M. ulcerans strain Kob), which confirms previous findings for this strain showing it has a plasmid DNA deletion [33] (Table 1). tested. As expected, The completed list of M. ulcerans unique CDS selected for further study included 13 chromosomal and 30 plasmid CDS (12 mls and 18 non-mls) and is shown in Table S3. In addition we included as positive controls two CDS encoding proteins Hsp65 and Hsp18 (MUL_2232) which have been reported to be antigenic but which are present in other mycobacteria species [34,35]. This resulted in a total of 45 proteins under investigation. "
434379,1," Cloning, expression and purification of M. ulcerans sequences in E. coli All 45 of these selected M. ulcerans sequences were amplified from strain Agy99 genomic DNA and 44 were cloned using the Gateway system into at least one of three different expression vectors, pDEST17 (N-terminal 6xHis tag), pET-DEST42 (C- terminal 6xHis tag) or pBAD-DEST49 (N-terminal thioredoxin tag, C-terminal 6xHis tag). We then successfully expressed 37 of 44 (84.1%) of the target sequences in E. coli as either N-terminal or C- terminal 6xHis tagged proteins or both at or near their predicted molecular weight (Table S3). Whilst 37 proteins could be expressed in quantities sufficient for western blotting, only 33 of these 37 were able to be produced in quantities sufficient for ELISA analysis. Seven proteins were unable to be expressed in E. coli as either N- or C-terminal 6xHis tagged fusions. Expression of two of these proteins (MUP016 and MUP017) from either pDEST17 or pET- DEST42 proved to be toxic to E. coli. Sequencing of the remaining five constructs showed in-frame fusions had been made and western blots on WCLs of E. coli bearing these constructs showed an absence of recombinant protein expression after induction (data not shown). Further attempts were made to salvage these seven proteins by cloning into pBAD-DEST49, a vector with arabinose inducible expression, an N-terminal thioredoxin tag and a C- terminal 6xHis tag, designed to improve protein expression and solubility, and by using E. coli strain C43, which has been optimized for the expression of toxic or membrane proteins [29,36]. However, these efforts were also unsuccessful and so these proteins were unable to be produced to levels sufficient for purification. "
434379,2," Diagnostic potential of M. ulcerans specific antigens To evaluate the potential for these proteins to be used to diagnose M. ulcerans infection or assess exposure to the bacterium, sera was collected from 39 IS2404 PCR confirmed BU patients (designated: patient) and 24 controls with no past or current diagnosis of BU (designated: endemic control). Both these groups came from the high BU prevalence Oue´me´ region in Benin. Sera were also obtained from 30 additional control subjects who lived in the BU non-endemic Ouidah region of Benin (designated: control). A pre-study decision was taken to analyze in these three groups rather than only patients versus non-endemic controls as previous studies had indicated the possibility of asymptomatic exposure to M. ulcerans in BU endemic areas [34]. Screening of 33 proteins by ELISA uncovered significantly higher IgG antibody responses in patients compared to non- endemic controls for the following seven proteins; MUP045, MUP057, MUL_0513, Hsp65, and the mycolactone Mls domains (p,0.05, Figure 1). (AT-propionate, ER, and KR-A domains) However, IgG responses of the endemic controls were not significantly different to those of patients for any of the seven proteins (Figure 1). Endemic controls had IgG responses that were significantly higher than those of non-endemic controls for the six of these seven proteins, suggesting that residents of endemic regions with no history of BU might have been exposed to M. ulcerans. The remaining 26 proteins, including the positive control antigen MUL_2232 (Hsp18), had no ability to elicit discriminatory antibody responses between any groups (Figure S1). When serum antibody responses for the proteins shown in Figure 1 were analysed according to disease state (i.e, plaque, plaque and oedema, ulcer, or plaque and ulcer), there was no significant difference in reactivity between disease state and endemic controls for each protein except for ER (Figure 2). Mean ELISA absorbance values for sera from patients with ulcers were significantly higher in their reactivity to the ER domain of the mycolactone PKS than endemic controls and other lesion types (p,0.05, Figure 2). "
434379,3," Seroepidemiological potential of M. ulcerans specific antigens We examined six of the seven proteins shown in Figure 1 to test if they could effectively distinguish subjects from BU endemic and BU non-endemic regions of Benin. We performed receiver- operator curve (ROC) analyses for each of these six antigens by combining the ELISA absorbance values for patient and endemic control groups (collectively referred to as BU-endemic) (Table 2) to calculate sensitivity and the non-endemic control group for specificity. ROC curves for each of the six proteins are shown in Figure 3. The ELISA OD cutoffs that maximized the accuracy of each of the six antigens are shown in Table 2 and the results indicated that a number of these proteins might be useful in determining new M. ulcerans endemic areas. In particular MUL_0513 and two of the Mls domains (AT-propionate, KR-B) all produced high area under curve (AUC, .0.8), and good sensitivity (.70%) and specificity (.80%). However the best antigen was Hsp65, with AUC of 0.932, 84.1% sensitivity and 93.3% specificity at an OD cut-off of 0.693. Hsp65 also had the highest likelihood ratio (12.6), indicating that an individual living in a BU endemic area is 12.6 times more likely to have a positive Hsp65 test than an individual residing in a non-endemic area. "
2491053,0,"Study population Of 34 enrolled patients, 12 were excluded from the study due to motion artifacts at PC-MRI (5/12), termination of the examination by the patient or MRI technician before completion (5/ 12), PC-MRI obtained at a suboptimal level (1/12) or image artifacts (1/12). Thus, 22 patients were included. Shunt surgery was performed in 17 of these, of which 16 (94%) were clinical responders. Other patient data are given in Table 1 and S1 File. Age and gender of four healthy controls are also presented in Table 1. "
2491053,1," ICP scores A summary of the ICP data from the iNPH patients are given in Table 2, and the full dataset from the patient cohort is presented in S1 Table. The coefficient of variation (CV = standard deviation/mean) illustrates the span of fluctuations in measured pulsatile and static ICP during overnight monitoring. Overnight monitoring of pulsatile and static (mean) ICP demonstrated large fluctuations, where CV was 26% (12, 41) and 128% (19, 5600), respectively (median and range). Fig 4 exemplifies recordings from a study patient demonstrating pulsatile ICP expressed by MWA (a), static ICP expressed by mean ICP (b) and heart rate (c) as a function of time. For patient specific measurements, MWA was to a very limited degree affected by HR, as the association between pulsatile ICP (MWA) and heart rate (HR) was low with median R = .02 (S1 Table). "
2491053,2," PC-MRI data from patients and healthy controls A summary of the PC-MRI data from patients and healthy controls is shown in Table 3, and an extended set of data from the PC-MRI studies of iNPH patients and healthy controls are presented in S2 and S3 Tables, respectively, and in S2 File. MRI-dP at level C2 was not different in iNPH patients and healthy subjects (P = .39). Only area of the subarachnoid space (ROI area and hence number of pixels) differed between groups (P = .016). "
2491053,3," Comparison of patient ICP scores and MRI-dP There were no associations between invasively measured pulsatile ICP and the non-invasive assessment of MRI-dP (R = -.18, P = .43) (Fig 5A) or mean ICP and MRI-dP (R = .10, P = .68) (Fig 5B). Moreover, the MRI-dP did not differ between individuals with MWA above or below established thresholds for shunting (P = .97), or healthy controls (P = .44) (Fig 6). "
2491053,4," Heart rate during PC-MRI and ICP monitoring There was a high correlation between heart rates (HR) from PC-MRI and invasive ICP moni- toring (R = .71, P = .001) (Fig 7A), and the Bland-Altman plot revealed no systematic differ- ences in HR registered during invasive ICP monitoring and PC-MRI (Fig 7B).

"
433520,0,"The inventory of water bug families in Centre Province of Cameroon was undertaken in Buruli ulcer endemic and non endemic areas, along the Nyong River. Among 7,407 collected specimens, seven aquatic Heteroptera families (Four true aquatic bugs and three semi-aquatic bugs) present in both areas were identified: Belostomatidae, Notonectidae, Nepidae, Corixidae, Gerridae, Mesoveliidae and Hydrometridae (Table 2 and Figure 2). The two most diversified families in our study were the families Notonectidae and Belostomatidae. Seven undeter- mined morphotypes were present in the Notonectidae family, two belonging to Anisopinae subfamily and five to Notonectinae subfamily. Appasus sp., Lethocerus and another unidentified mor- photype were present in the Belostomatidae family. Only one subfamily was identified in Nepidae and Corixidae families, respectively Micronectinae and Ranatrinae. All families identified in this study can be characterized as carnivorous predatory fluid- feeders, with the exception of the Corixidae family (plant feeders). Three families (Belostomatidae, Notonectidae, Nepidae), among the six carnivorous ones, are able to bite humans and to fly. "
433520,1," Cameroon has a tropical climate which varies from equatorial in the South to Sahelian in the North. The equatorial South, where the Buruli ulcer endemic area is located, has two wet seasons and two dry seasons. One wet season occurs between March and June and the main wet season occurs between August and November. One dry season occurs between June and August and the main dry season occurs between December and March. The population dynamics of water bugs was investigated in an endemic area for Buruli Ulcer (district of Akonolinga). In order to get comparable results, insects were captured at periodic intervals by the same operator (with standardized sampling methods), in the same water body each time. Large fluctuations of water bug density were observed among the samples (Figure 3A). The highest number of collected insects per sampling was recorded in January, during the long dry season (median = 369), whereas in other months, the median number of captured insects per sampling varied between 25 and 94 specimens (p,0.001, according to the negative binomial regression model estimating the count of insects per sampling). With respect to water bug families, the following variations in the sample composition were observed: out of seven families, four families (Belostomatidae, Notonectidae, Gerridae, Nepidae) were collected throughout the study period (Figure 3B), whereas the three other families (Corixidae, Mesoveliidae and Hydrometridae) were found only in January and/or April (Figure 3B). The most abundant family was Notonectidae (67% of total collected water bugs). The proportions for the other families were: 14.2% (Belostomatidae), 10.5% (Gerridae), 5.6% (Corixidae), 1% (Hy- drometridae) and 0.1% (Mesoveliidae). The relative abundance of families fluctuated over the year. For example, Belostomatidae and Notonectidae represented respectively 59.8% and 34.3% of total insects in October, and 10.1% and 88.4% in November (Figure 3B). Moreover it was observed that in January Corixidae reached the highest abundance (10.2% out of total water bugs), whereas in January and April the highest water bug diversity was noticed (Figure 3B). All these data suggest that the long dry season corresponds to the period during which highest water bug diversity and abundance occur. "
433520,2," Detection of M. ulcerans in samples collected in Buruli ulcer endemic and non endemic sites was performed by PCR targeting the IS2404 insertion and the KR domain which encodes a polyketide synthase. From 3647 water bugs collected in the endemic area, 68 pools out of 616 (11%) were positive for both markers, IS2404 and Ketoreductase (Figure 4A). In addition M. ulcerans DNA was detected in five out of seven analyzed insect families. The rate of colonization in these pools was around 10%, except for the Corixidae family (Micronectinae) captured only in January, for which the rate reached 43.7% (p = 0.008, Pearson Chi-square test) (Figure 4B). Of note, this result was confirmed for individual Corixidae specimens (n = 72). However, given the very low number of collected water bugs from Mesoveliidae and Hydro- metridae families (33 and 9 specimens, respectively), it is difficult to draw clear conclusions, in this case, about their possible subversion as hosts for M. ulcerans. The rate of insect colonization by M. ulcerans fluctuated between 1.4% and 33.9% according to the sampling period, with (p = 0.008, Pearson Chi-square test) a peak in July (33.9%) (Figure 4A). Moreover, in the present study, no correlation was established between abundance of water bugs and rate of colonization of water bugs by M. ulcerans. All families -notably Belostomatidae, Notonectinae and Gerridae- displayed very ulcerans similar (Figure 4C), with the exception of Nepidae (for which the sample size was limited). "
433520,3," From 422 water bugs caught in a Buruli ulcer non endemic area, no pool out of 80 was found positive (Table 3). Significantly, in these same April and July periods, 11.5% and 33.9%, respectively, pools were found positive in the endemic site situated 100 kms away. "
433520,4," Only living Belostomatidae insects of the genus Appasus sp. (Figure 5A and B) were allowed to salivate, for technical reasons. The saliva of these insects was first monitored for the presence of M. ulcerans DNA (Figure 5A and B). The individual saliva samples analysed by IS2404 and KR PCR were found positive in 51/293 of cases (17.4%), with a peak in July. Similar patterns were observed with homogenate tissue of Appasus (Figure 5C). Interestingly, few acid-fast bacilli were observed in saliva samples of three individual positive pools (November, April and July). Their viability was evaluated by inoculation of PCR positive saliva into the tails of 21 Balb/c mice. Using quantitative PCR, quantity of inoculated bacilli was determined to range between 16102 and 56103 bacilli per ml. Four months after the subcutaneous injection, three mice displayed lesions typical of M. ulcerans, in which acid-fast bacilli were detected. Quantity of bacilli was estimated by quantitative PCR to range between 66104 and 36105 bacilli per ml of grounded tissue. This result suggests growth of Mycobacterium ulcerans in mouse tail. It can be noticed, however, that conventional methods failed to isolate the bacilli by culture from mouse tissues presenting clinical lesions. "
1691937,0,"By simultaneously accounting for environmental and water bug transmission, we quantify the contribution of each mode of transmission to the temporal dynamics of BU cases in Akonolinga under a broad range of epidemi-ological and environmental parameters (Table 1). The best fit of mathematical models (AIC = 57.49) accurately predicted the monthly dynamics of observed BU cases (Fig. 2A) and suggested an exclusive role for environmental transmission (ratio λ MU/λ WB larger than 103). In addition, the mean force of infection in the set of 35 best fits that are considered equivalent (those with an AIC difference from best model lower than 2) was higher for the environmental transmission than for water bug transmission in 34 out of 35 fits. The ratio λ MU/λ WB, quantifying the importance of environmental transmission over water bug transmission, ranged from 0.86 to more than 106, with a median value of 276 (Fig. 2B). Environmental transmission thus contributed to almost the entire burden of BU infections in our temporal model. The predictions from this set of best parameters had a high and significant correlation with the observed number of BU cases (Fig. 2C), with an R2 of 0.60 and 0.69 for incubation periods of 3 and 5 months respectively (these are the incubation periods present in the best models). "
1691937,1," For the environmental transmission, the concentration of MU provided a better prediction of the temporal dynamics of the observed cases of BU than MU positivity. Indeed, fitted models based on MU concentration represented 100% of the total set of best 35 fits. A linear relationship between MU concentration and the force of infection, with a time of 6 months from infection to treatment, represented nearly two thirds of the fits. The mean AIC was lower in these fits than for fits with other times and functional links (Table 2). The mean value of this linear relationship is shown in Fig. 3A, along with the maximum and minimum values based on the parameters of the other best fits. "
1691937,2," Our statistical models of MU spatial associations with BU incidence in both Akonolinga and Bankim indi-cate similar drivers as the mathematical model of temporal dynamics (Table 2). In the univariate linear models, environmental transmission was the only statistically significant predictor of BU incidence in populations within a 5km buffer. MU positivity in a water body was the best spatial predictor (R2 = 0.15, p-value< 0.05), while MU concentration was only significant at the 90% level (R2 = 0.09, p-value< 0.1). None of the variables for the water bug transmission showed any association with BU cases (R2 = 0.03, p-value = 0.77 for water bug positivity and R2 = 0.02, p-value = 0.36 for number of infected water bugs). Bivariate analyses in which one variable for water bug transmission was added at a time did not improve the model with the environmental transmission only. "
1691937,3," We further explored whether a non-linear relationship between the MU environmental variables and BU incidence was more likely than a linear link by fitting GAMs of different spans. A GAM with a threshold effect and a saturation value significantly improved the results of the linear model for MU positivity (Table 2), but none of the nonlinear models improved the results for MU concentration. The predictions of the best statistical model are shown in Fig. 3B, along with their 95% confidence intervals (see Supplementary Materials, section S8 for a detailed description of all the statistical results). "
1691937,4," In order to understand whether the spatial and temporal models provided the same information on the link between environmental MU and BU, we explored the relationship between MU positivity and MU concentration (Fig. 3C). The two variables were highly correlated, suggesting that both positivity and concentration provide similar information about MU environmental load (Spearman’s correlation test, p-value < 0.01 for both datasets). Furthermore, there was a clear plateau in MU concentration at higher MU positivity levels for both the temporal and spatial datasets. This suggests that once a positivity level was reached, this did not result in higher concentra-tion in the samples. This would explain why we obtain a linear link with BU incidence for MU concentration but a saturation effect for MU positivity. We finally evaluated the strength of correlation between the temporal and spatial predictions for MU concentration only, and then for MU positivity. We found positive and significant cor-relations between the predictions of both models for each of these variables (Supplementary Materials, Section S6). "
1982497,0,"We performed MRV in 830 patients. The examination revealed a slower blood flow in IJVs. Only 17 patients (2%) showed no such flow patterns. The pathologies mentioned were seen: on the right side in 6% of scanned MS patients, on the left side – 15%, on both sides with right-side predominance – 22%, on both sides with left-side predominance – 34%, bilaterally with no side predominance – 19%. In 17 cases (2%), a more pronounced pathology was seen: slower blood flow in IJVs, vertebral, subclavian and also in the left brachiocephalic veins. Moreover, in 42 cases (5%), a decreased blood flow in the AV was detected (Table 1). "
429330,0,"Of the 195 probable Buruli ulcer cases recorded in Bankim district hospital since January 2007, 100 cases were contacted, 88 were questioned, and 77 retained for analysis. Only one BU patient refused to participate. Cases were not included or not considered for analysis if they reported having suffered from BU for ten years or longer (n = 11), if one relative (parent, child or sibling) was already included in the study (n = 5) or if their distant location did not allow us to investigate community controls (n = 6). Details of the inclusion process are provided in Figure 1. Community controls were randomly selected in the population census for 74 cases. For 3 cases living in villages for which census data were not available, controls were included from randomly selected houses. The main reasons for controls not participating were long- term or repeated absence (n = 30, 45%), refusal (n = 14, 21%), unable to be found (n = 8, 12%), or related to a case (n = 5, 7%). The main analysis was performed on 77 cases (72 probable and 5 laboratory confirmed cases) matched with 153 community controls. Out of 77 cases analyzed, 76 were matched with two controls and one case was matched with one control only. Familial controls were recruited when available, i.e. mainly for children. Case-familial control analysis was performed on 37 cases and 49 controls. These were distributed as follows: 12 groups of one case and two controls and 25 groups of one case and one control. Among controls, 42 were siblings, 5 were other relatives (half-brother or sister, cousin) and two were unrelated children living in the same household. "
429330,1," Most patients were healed, except for 16, who presented with lesions still not scarred (Table S1). Five cases could be confirmed, but laboratory confirmation could not be obtained for 11 who were already undergoing treatment. About as many cases were men (n = 40) as women (n = 37). Median age of analyzed cases was 14 years (Inter-quartile Range (IQR) = [10–36.5]). Lesions classically presented on lower (n = 39, 49%), and upper limbs (n = 29, 38%). Only 3 patients presented with multiple lesions, and 8 (10%) presented with head or trunk lesions. Median (IQR) time from onset of disease to day of interview was 17 (9–26) months, ranging from 15 days to 7 years. The majority of patients did not associate their disease with any particular circumstance, but 9 linked it to a wound and 17 to insect bites. The overall population of the study, presented in Table 1, showed an important heterogeneity of ethnic groups and origins. Tikari and Kwadja farmers are indigenous and represented 33% of controls, but Yamba and Mambila farmers originating from neighboring regions were also well represented, respectively 29% and 12% of the control population, respectively. Kotoko people, originating from the Extreme-North Cameroon, are also found in Bankim, where they settled on the banks of the Mappe´ Lake and currently handle the commercial fishing business. Fulani-related Mbororos live usually in settlements in the savanna where they traditionally raise cattle. Some of them practice transhumant pastoralism. Adults principally engaged in farming activities. Most children between 6 and 12 years old reported going to school (94%), and a majority of them participated in farming during weekends and holidays or during seasons when additional workforce was required (85%). Education level was low with few persons over 12 years of age having secondary education. "
429330,2," Univariate analysis. Neither ethnic group, activity nor education level was significantly associated with BU (Table 1). A history of BCG vaccination, assessed through the presence of a scar on the forearm, showed a nearly significant protection against BU. Compound environment was associated with an increased risk when small domestic animals such as poultry, ducks, goats or pigs, were present (Odds Ratio (OR) 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI] = 2.6 [1.2–5.7], p = 0.01) and when the compound was close to a water body (OR [95%CI] = 2.6 [1.1–5.8], p = 0.02). Use of specific light source (petrol lamp, electricity) and whether it burnt overnight or not, were not associated with the disease. Exposure to insects was assessed by questioning about specific insects bites (Table 2). Cases reported more frequently being bitten by hematophagous insects belonging to the Chrysops genus (Tabanidae), but the association was not significant. BU was significantly associated with reporting history of small skin lesions due to scratching after an insect bite (OR [95%CI] = 2.1 [1.2–3.7], p = 0.01). Mosquito coils were seldom used and no association with BU was found. When compared to never using a bed net, systematic bed net use was associated with protection from BU and occasional use was associated with an increased risk (systematic/none: OR [95%CI] = 0.6 [0.3–1.2], occasional/none: OR [95%CI] = 2.5 [1.0–6.4]; p = 0.01). Most bed nets had been bought from the local market and were not insecticide-treated. Net insecticide treatment did not appear associated with better protection, nor did the absence of holes. Exposure to water was assessed for various activities (Table 3). Fishing was a common secondary occupation among all categories of population but the study included few professional fishermen. Fishing activity, season, place or techniques used were not found to have statistically significant association with the disease. Bathing activities were separated into bathing for hygiene and for leisure. Bathing for hygiene was statistically associated with an increased risk of BU when baths were taken in the Mbam, a river flowing south from the district (OR [95%CI] = 4.4 [1.2–17], p = 0.02). Bathing in the barrage lake or other water bodies was not associated with a statistically significant change in the risk of disease. Bathing for leisure was a common activity for nearly all children and did not significantly increase risk. Domestic water supply and clothes washing activities were investigated, but no significant difference in exposure was found between cases and controls. Water sources were mainly rivers, streams or wells. Protected water sources were limited to urban compounds and not necessarily used for all activities. Whether unprotected water sources were running or stagnant was difficult to assess, but no statistically significant association was found between BU and declared characteristics of the water source. Not wearing shoes during domestic water supply or clothes washing was significantly associated with an increased risk of BU (OR [95%CI] = 6.7 [1.8–24.3], p = 0.002). Type of clothing or shoes worn during any other water-related activity was not associated with a significant risk of BU. Almost all cases and controls participated in farming activities (Table 4). Youngest children were considered participating when they accompanied their parents. Nearly all farmers planted corn. Growing other food crops was associated with a decreased risk of disease: growing cassava (OR [95%CI] = 0.4 [0.2–0.7], p = 0.001) or beans (OR [95%CI] = 0.5 [0.3–1.0], p = 0.05) presented a significantly decreased risk. Growing banana (sweet or plantain), groundnut and tubers like yam, sweet potato or taro was also associated with a small protection that did not reach significance level. In contrast, commercial crops like coffee and pepper were not associated with disease. Cases were more likely than controls to have a longer walking time to their fields and to sleep there. They more frequently reported cultivating areas that flooded during the rainy season. Cases also more often declared having a garden or a vegetable patch near their houses, and watering these plots was associated with a significantly increased risk. Clothing worn during farming activities was not associated with a risk of BU. Wounds were frequent in the population, and were usually acquired during farming activities (Table 3). Controls reported being wounded while clearing the field more often than cases. Several wound treatments were associated with a change in BU risk: using alcohol or soap to cleanse the wound were protective practices, while using no treatment led to an increased risk of disease. Rubbing leaves (usually the sap of a common Lamiaceae referred to as ‘‘benjamin’’) or applying ground tablets or ointment bought on the market was not significantly associated with the risk of BU disease. Dressing the wound was a protective practice when the bandage - either a piece of cloth or adhesive bandage - was regularly changed. "
429330,3," Multivariate analysis. For multivariate analysis, the main recoded in two categories, exposure ‘‘bed net use’’ was ‘‘Systematic bed net use Yes/No’’ by pooling the two categories ‘‘Never’’ and ‘‘Rare to often’’, which were both associated with an increased risk of disease in the univariate analysis (Table 5). Independent factors associated with an increased risk of BU were bathing for hygiene in the Mbam River (OR [95%CI] = 6.9 [1.4–35], p = 0.02) and reporting small scratch wounds after insect bites (OR [95%CI] = 3.8[1.0–14], p = 0.03). Factors independent- ly associated with a decreased risk were systematic use of a bed net (OR [95%CI] = 0.4 [0.2–0.9], p = 0.04), use of soap to cleanse wounds (OR [95%CI] = 0.1 [0.03–0.3], p,0.001) and growing cassava (OR [95%CI] = 0.3 [0.2–0.7], p = 0.005). No significant interaction was found in the final model between variables and a variable ‘‘interviewer’’. No significant interaction was found between these variables and age category or gender. Detailed results of variable selection process are provided in supplementary text S1. "
429330,4," Univariate analysis showed a few associations that did not reach significance level (table S2). Of note among those were: bed net use which was associated with a decreased risk (OR [95%CI] = 0.4 [0.1–1.4], p = 0.13); watering a garden, associated with an increased risk (OR [95%CI] = 3.1 [0.6–15], p = 0.13); and reporting scratch wounds after insect bites, associated with an increased risk of BU (OR [95%CI] = 2.3 [0.8–6.7], p = 0.10). No significant association with BU was revealed in multivariate analysis (table S2). "
429330,5," If we assume that the relationship between a protective factor and risk decrease is truly causal, we can calculate the proportion of cases in the general population (represented by the controls) prevented by this protective factor, based on the relative risk and the frequency of the factor in the general population (again, represented by controls). The preventive fraction for systematic bed net use was 32% (proportion of controls systematically using a bed net: 53%, OR = 0.4). Likewise, the fraction of cases prevented by adequate wound hygiene practices (using soap to cleanse wounds) was 34% (proportion of controls using soap: 38%, OR = 0.1). "
193334,0,"The demographic and clinical characteristics of all the 79 TGA patients, and the subset of 45 patients and 45 age- and sex-matched controls who underwent complete MRI, MRA, and MRV examinations are shown in Table 1. The patients and controls did not differ significantly in terms of their vascular risk factors. The TAMVs, FVs, and CSAs of the bilateral IJVs in the age- and sex-matched 45 patients and 45 controls are shown in Table 2. As compared to the controls, the TGA patients exhibited significantly lower TAMVS at the J2 and J3 segments of the bilateral IJVs. They also exhibited significantly lower FVs in the left IJV at the J2 and J3 segments and in the left VV. The FVs were not significantly lower in the right IJV; however, the patients still exhibited significantly lower total flow volumes in the bilateral IJVs and VVs. In both the patients and controls, the CSAs of the bilateral IJVs were not significantly different either at the J2 or J3 segment. The TGA patients exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of IJVVI (patients vs. controls: 82 vs. 44%); however, the side-specific prevalence was significantly greater on the left side (patients vs. controls: 53 vs. 20%), while the right-sided prevalence being comparable between the patients and controls (patients vs. controls: 29 vs. 24%). Furthermore, we detected a significant difference in the prevalence of left-sided IJVVI between the subjects with and without the presence of left BCV compression/stenosis [19 (61%) vs. 14 (24%), p = 0.0044]. "
193334,1," We have often observed that the IJV drainage flow usually appears ~4–8 s after initiating the VM, so we simply defined the complete absence of IJV drainage flow at the J2 or J3 segment within 10 s of initiating the VM as IJV “non-patency.” Table 3 displays the relationship between the ultrasound findings of IJV non-patency during the VM, and the MRI findings of venous compression/obstruction or TS hypoplasia in those 90 study subjects (45 patients and 45 controls). For the left IJV, the prevalence of ultrasound-detected IJV non-patency during the VM was significantly greater at the J2 segment in the study subjects with an upstream TS hypoplasia than that in the patients without such hypoplasia (56.9 vs. 44.3%, respectively; p = 0.0425). For the right IJV, the prevalence of IJV non-patency at the J2 segment was significantly higher in the patients with IJV compression at C1 or C4 than in the patients without such compression (62.07 vs. 28.57%, respectively; p = 0.0111). We found no significant difference in the prevalence of bilateral IJV non-patency during the VM between those age- and sex-matched patients and controls who underwent complete MRI examinations. However, since there are no statistical differences in all the flow profiles between two groups of TGA patients with and without venous MR imaging as shown in Table S1, thus we included the 34 patients who underwent complete ultrasound examinations but incomplete MRI examinations for analysis, we found a significant difference in the prevalence of IJV non-patency during the VM between the patients and controls (Table 4). Specifically, we found that the patients exhibited significantly higher IJV non-patency at the right J3 segment (patients: 32.1%; controls: 11.6%; p = 0.0128), but not significantly higher in the left J3 segment (patients: 49.35%; controls: 37.21%), and the right J2 segment (patients: 44.00%; controls: 32.56%). "
432326,0,"M. ulcerans phylogeny in Cameroon We sequenced the genomes of 82 M. ulcerans strains isolated from 45 IS2404 qPCR confirmed Cameroonian BU patients. Patients were identified between 2010 and 2012 and came from two geographically separated BU endemic regions of Cameroon, the Mapé and the Nyong river ba- sins. Prior to treatment, ulcerative lesions were sampled with a cotton swab for laboratory con- firmation of the clinical diagnosis, primary isolation of the disease causing organism and WGS of the isolated M. ulcerans strains. The mapping of the obtained Illumina sequencing reads against the reference strain resulted in an average coverage of 380 reads per position per genome. We reconstructed the phylogenet- ic relationship among 45 Cameroonian (one strain per patient), five Ghanaian and three Beni- nese M. ulcerans isolates based on 26,740 variable nucleotide positions, rooting the tree using a published M. marinum genome (Fig 1). The phylogenetic tree showed a very strong geographi- cal structure. The chromosome tree of the Cameroonian M. ulcerans isolates showed two dis- tinct lineages, the first one containing all the Nyong river basin isolates (Nyong lineage) and the second one all the isolates from the Mapé region (Mapé lineage). The Mapé river basin iso- lates were more closely related to a set of published genomes [13] of Ghanaian and Beninese isolates that we included in the analysis, than to the Nyong lineage. The two Cameroonian clonal complexes differed in altogether 828 SNPs shared by all members of the respective line- ages (Fig 1). The plasmid phylogeny reflected the topology of the M. ulcerans chromosome phylogenetic tree (Fig 1), supporting the hypothesis of a unique acquisition of the plasmid during the emer- gence of M. ulcerans [30] followed by parallel evolution between the chromosome and the plasmid. "
432326,1," Genetic diversity among the Cameroonian isolates We analysed the genetic diversity within the two Cameroonian geographical lineages separately (Fig 2). The genetic diversity observed for the Nyong river basin isolates (median pairwise SNP difference = 26.2 SNPs) was significantly higher (p-value < 0.0001) than for the Mapé basin isolates (median pairwise SNP difference = 7.6 SNPs). Furthermore, an analysis of the pairwise geographic distance of seven isolates from the Eastern Nyong river basin (approximately 1090 km2) and of four isolates from Western Nyong (approximately 625km2) still yielded values that were higher (median 24 and 36 pairwise SNP difference) than for the Mapé isolates (Fig 2). The higher genetic diversity thus does not seem to be related to the broader geographical distribution for the Nyong river basin isolates (approximately 8600 km2) compared to the Mapé river basin isolates (approximately 6400 km2) (Fig 3A2 and 3B2). These results were also reflected in the phylogenetic tree, where branch lengths were longer for the Nyong river basin strains than for the Mapé river basin isolates (Fig 1). The gene encoding for rpoB, which is known to harbour drug resistance mutations against rifampicin in M. tuberculosis [31], was not affected by SNPs in any of the M. ulcerans strains analysed here. When analysing the nucleotide diversity distribution along the chromosome by calculating the average nucleotide pairwise diversity per site (Pi) for both lineages, 99.9% of the genome was found to be highly conserved (S1 Fig). However, the average nucleotide diversity per site for the Nyong river basin lineage was 3.2 times higher than for the Mapé river basin lineage (4.10e-6 versus 1.3e-6). The regions of the genome with higher nucleotide diversity (0.375e-4 and 1.25e-4, respectively) seemed randomly distributed across the chromosome for both line- ages (S2 Fig) and the gene content of these regions varied between the two Cameroonian line- ages, comprising affected genes of diverse functionalities (S3 Table). "
432326,2," Phylogeographic analysis of the Cameroonian M. ulcerans isolates In order to analyse the distribution of genetic variants within the endemic areas, we recon- structed median joining networks for the sequenced strains and mapped the places of residence of the patients from which the strains originated (Fig 3). The network of the Mapé river basin isolates had a star structure with two isolates (BP130 and BP140) at the centre. All the other isolates were connected to this centre and separated by three to nine SNPs. While the SNP distance between the two central strains was zero, the geo- graphical distance between the corresponding residence places of the two corresponding pa- tients was 19.5 km. A total of four clusters were distinguished in the network: blue formed by two isolates, green and yellow formed by three isolates each and the red cluster as a complex structure formed by nine strains. The strains belonging to the red cluster shared two SNPs, the green ones also two SNPs, the yellow ones four and the blue ones shared three SNPs. All the grey strains were not forming clusters and differed by 1 to 11 SNPs from the central strains. In the network of the Nyong river basin isolates we observed only three clusters formed by three (green), seven (red) and one strain (blue). The isolates from the red cluster shared six SNPs, while the isolates from the green one shared only two SNPs. Overall, for both BU endemic areas in Cameroon we did not find a clear correlation between the genetic networks and the geographic distribution of the houses where the patients lived in the year prior to the onset of BU disease (Fig 3). Statistical analysis with the Mantel test for the smaller subset of Nyong sam- ples resulted in a positive and marginally significant correlation between the geographic and genetic distances (r = 0.2785, p-value = 0.054), whereas the test performed for the Mapé set of isolates resulted in a small non-significant negative correlation (r = -0.04774, p-value = 0.676). "
432326,3," Rate of acquisition of SNPs In the course of this genomic epidemiological study we obtained from three patients isolates from two or three different time points during the course of their disease (Table 1). When com- paring the SNP diversity between the isolates from the same patient, only one SNP difference was observed between two sequential isolates (Table 1). The affected gene (MUL_1383) en- coded for a hypothetical protein and the detected mutation was synonymous. No SNP differ- ence was observed between two strains isolated from two distant ulcers of one patient (Table 1). "
2547425,0,"CCSVI criteria I - Reflux in the IJV or VV in sitting and supine posture. We found no evidence of reflux using colour and duplex Doppler at any level bilaterally in either of the IJV or VV in any subject (Table 2). Reflux cannot be assessed in the transverse plane (Figure S3). Venous flow was spontaneous, phasic and caudal in both supine and upright positions (Figure S4). Reflux (>0.88 s) was never seen. In one control subject a vertebral vein was not visualized in the supine position. "
2547425,1, CCSVI criteria II - Reflux or no flow in the DCV. Flow in a DCV was assessed in the supine position. In one MS patient a DCV was not seen. There was no evidence of either reflux or cessation of flow in any of the study groups (Table 2). flow was mono-directional and did not change with either inspiration or expiration (Figure S5). 
2547425,2," CCSVI criteria III - High Resolution B-mode evidence of IJV anomalies or stenosis. Gray scale assessment of the IJV displayed anomalies in 3 out of 199 subjects (1.5%, see Table 2). The B-mode anomalies appeared as malformed or irregular valve movements. In all subjects, flow patterns were not altered and the anomalies did not represent vascular narrowing. There was no significant difference in maximum IJV velocities between matched cases and controls. After adjusting for the Bonferroni correction, none of these differences was statistically significant at any location (J1, J2, J3) or at either side (right or left). "
2547425,3," CCSVI criteria IV - Flow not detectable by Doppler in the IJVs and/or VVs despite numerous inspirations in sitting and supine posture. Flow was detected in all patients with the exception of one control patient in whom one VV was seen in the upright position but not in supine. was displayed in both planes at J1, J2 and J3 by optimizing PRF, angle of insonation and color gains (Figure S6). There was no evidence of blockage found in either study group or at any of the levels measured (Table 2). "
2547425,4, CCSVI criteria V - Reverted postural control of the main cerebral venous outflow pathways (IJV CSA supine-upright). ΔCSA was calculated as supine - upright. A negative ΔCSA would reflect abnormal venous drainage in accordance with the Zamboni hypothesis that the supine CSA would be diminished in patients with MS. Two MS patients and one control subject demonstrated a negative ΔCSA (Table 2). 
2547425,5," Zamboni criteria. The number of study participants who fulfilled each Zamboni criteria is shown in Table 2. No participants satisfied the first, second, or fourth criteria, three fulfilled the third criterion and three satisfied the fifth criterion. Exact conditional logistic regression analysis reveals no differences between cases and controls for any of the five criteria. Amongst all participants only one PPMS patient fulfilled the minimum two of five Zamboni ultrasound criteria for CCSVI and none filled more than two (Table 3). Analysis of the Zamboni rule with exact conditional logistic regression reveals no difference between cases and controls (p = 0.991; Table 4). Due to the sparse nature of the data (i.e., infrequent positive criteria) we could not obtain a point estimate of the odds ratio and its corresponding 95% confidence interval. "
2547425,6, Magnetic resonance imaging The between-reader reproducibility of MRI flow measurements was high—with ICC values varying from 0.81 to 0.94 for all segments. The comparison between absolute flow in the high neck and mid-neck IJVs as well as the straight sinus of all MS cases and control subjects is shown in Figure 1. There are no statistically significant differences between these flow values. A consistent finding was that flow in the right IJV was always higher than that in the left IJV. The differences in flow asymmetry (right IJV – left IJV) between MS cases and controls for the upper IJV and mid-neck IJV were not statistically significant (Table 5). Examination of the extra- and intra-cranial venous anatomy using contrast MRV revealed no evidence of stenoses or other venous abnormalities between cases and controls.
