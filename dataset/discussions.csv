1421389,0," HSV-1 encephalitis usually presents fulminantly in immunocompetent individuals with fever, altered mental status, seizures, CSF and EEG findings, and temporal lobe lesions on MRI. Our patient's illness began with recurrent herpes simplex labialis, which spread to the left trigeminal nerve and left L5 nerve root over the course of four weeks. Besides her dysesthesias, her symptoms included headache, low-grade fever, weight loss, mild personality change and short-term memory loss, which were no longer exhibited on presentation. Her CSF contained mildly elevated levels of lymphocytes (WBC: 6 cells/μL), erythrocytes (RBC: 63 cells/μL), and protein (49 mg/dL); owing to the fact that cell counts were taken from the fourth tube collected, the probability of a traumatic lumbar puncture is low. Beyond her MRI findings of peri-ventriculitis and basal meningitis particularly over the brainstem, our patient had no temporal lobe abnormalities, although approximately 10% of patients with PCR-proven HSV encephalitis do not demonstrate temporal lobe involvement. In addition, other cases of brainstem encephalitis due to HSV have been reported with viral reactivation possibly occurring in the trigeminal nerve (relevant references are available upon request from the corresponding author). Regarding involvement of white matter, other cases of extratemporal HSV encephalitis have also shown this pattern on neuroimaging, particularly during chronic or subacute phases of illness; often being associated with clinical relapse and viral persistence; and sometimes showing demyelination in addition to edema, inflammatory change, and viral inclusions on a microscopic level (relevant references are available upon request from the corresponding author). Overall, our patient's clinical presentation, borderline pleocytosis in the CSF, and extratemporal findings on MRI were consistent with a more subacute course of HSV-1 encephalitis proven by PCR, presumably due to immunosuppression from CLL. "
1421389,1," Patients with CLL often manifest hypogammaglobulinemia and neutropenia early in the course of the disease, with eventual T cell deficiency leading to recurrent sinopulmonary infections with Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and herpes zoster and simplex viruses. However, HSV-1 encephalitis is a rare presentation of CLL. Other central nervous system (CNS) infections have been reported in patients with CLL, namely progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, West Nile virus encephalitis, and Listeria monocytogenes encephalitis. The occurrence of HSV-1 encephalitis in immunocompromised patients has rarely been reported. Classic clinical presentations with atypical laboratory studies have been described in a patient with metastatic colon cancer four weeks after receiving chemotherapy [2], three patients who were immunosuppressed with either Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [3–5], and another patient with glioblastoma multiforme on dexamethasone [5]. Atypical clinical presentations of HSV encephalitis have been described in patients receiving steroids, and also occur in 2% of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with neurological symptoms, usually in association with CD4 T cell counts <200 cells/μL [6]. "
1421389,2," The literature exploring the association of MS with CLL is very limited. Neither the development of CLL prior to the development of MS, nor the reverse, have been shown to have an association in retrospective studies ([7]; additional references are available upon request from the corresponding author). Only one study has shown an increased risk of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in first-degree relatives of patients with MS, and this is thought to be related to shared environmental and constitutional factors such as infection with Epstein-Barr virus or expression of the HLA-DR2 allele. "
1421389,3," The development of clinical symptoms and signs of MS in our patient so soon after her episode of HSV-1 encephalitis, as well as her earlier atypical peri-ventricular pattern of MRI findings, suggests a possible association between the infection and subsequent diagnosis of MS. On the one hand, it is possible that our patient's initial illness was an early manifestation of MS with asymptomatic HSV-1 colonization in the CNS, and that her initial improvement could be attributable to receiving dexamethasone for 1 day. Of note, detection of HSV DNA in CSF by PCR has a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of >95% [8]. True positives have been reported in patients who are asymptomatic, and false positives have been reported due to cross-contamination. Additionally, the MRI from our patient's first admission demonstrated basal meningitis, which is an atypical feature of MS (see Figure 3). On the other hand, our patient's recent recurrence of herpes labialis, the positive CSF PCR for HSV-1, and her continued improvement over nine days while receiving intravenous aciclovir support the argument that HSV-1 infection was the reason for her initial illness. Regarding the nature of the illness, CSF PCR for HSV has been recently used by others to diagnose mild cases of HSV encephalitis, to diagnose atypical cases of adult HSV encephalitis involving polyradiculoneuritis and inflammatory syndrome with arachnoiditis, and to define a pathogenic role of HSV in episodes unlikely to be entirely CNS viral infections (relevant references are available upon request from the corresponding author). Furthermore, the fact that the patient's repeat CSF PCR result for HSV-1 was negative on her second admission helps support that her initial encephalitis was related to HSV-1 even if some demyelination due to MS had already begun. Although studies of the CSF such as oligoclonal banding were not performed or indicated during her first admission to explore the likelihood of MS, the patient denied any history of urinary incontinence, vision loss, unilateral blurred vision, double vision, gait disturbance, or paresthesias before her current illness. However, the expansion of previous areas of peri-ventriculitis on the patient's second admission do raise the possibility of her first admission involving concurrent HSV-1 encephalitis and MS. "
1421389,4," A recent study of patients with MS has demonstrated alterations in dendritic cell antigens and interferon expression in response to HSV-1 challenge to mononuclear cells [9]. Whether such an impaired immune response to viral infection is present before the development of MS is unknown. Additionally, patients with MS are known to have elevated antibody titers to HSV-1 in the CSF, but this is purported to be non-specific and studies of CSF PCR for HSV-1 in patients with MS have failed to find a statistically significant association [10]. There is evidence of association between infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and subsequent diagnosis of MS, as well as between CNS infection with human herpesvirus 6 variant A (HHV6A) and concurrent MS [10]; however causal relationships are yet unproven. Our patient did not undergo serological EBV testing or CSF studies for HHV6 during her admissions."
653044,0," In the present work we described a lumped parameter model of the cerebrospinal venous network based on a realistic anatomical paradigm, aimed at determining if an extracranial morphological change can cause an intracranial venous flow alteration. Compared to previously published models of the physiologic and impaired cerebrospinal venous circulation [19, 21, 23, 25, 26], our model was designed with a detailed correspondence between its elements and anatomy. The accuracy of the model was evaluated comparing the flow estimates with that obtained with PC-MRI from a group of healthy subjects. We applied the model to mimic obstruction of the main extracranial veins and to estimate the changes in intracranial pressure and flow. We compared the location of flow inversion simulated with IJV obstruction and what we observed with ECD in a group of 112 MS patients. "
653044,1," Comparison between model estimates and MRI measures The physiologic flow rates computed by the model were realistic in terms of direction (Fig. 2) and amplitudes (Fig. 3). These agreements were not obvious since we a priori set the arterial input flow directions; the network connections; the venous diameters and lengths and the zero-level pressure at two points of the hydraulic system. We did not impose the venous flow directions or pressures, with the exception of the pressures in subclavian vein and the right atrium. In regards to the flow amplitude, the mean flow rates estimated with MRI were not significantly different from those predicted by the model, with the exception of ISS and ICVl. The best correspondence between predicted and measured flow rates were found for those vessels whose anatomy can be approximated by an almost straight pipe of constant cross sectional area, i.e., where the basic assumption for Poiseuille's law holds, and whose dimension, shape and blood velocity allowed for the acquisition of good quality PC MRI data. The significant difference between ISS (p=0.004) and ICVl (p=0.01) flow rates and those predicted by the model could be due to the small dimensions and low flow velocity of all these vessels and to the curve shape of the ISS. The same reasons could explain the trend for difference found between ICVr and both the SPS (p=0.06). Regarding the SSS, its cross sectional dimensions increased anteriorly to posteriorly; as did its flow rate, consistently with the presence of the superior cerebral veins converging into it. We modeled the SSS as a single resistance and did not model the superior cerebral veins due to their high inter- subject variability in terms of number and size. For these matters the flow rate measured with the anterior, but not posterior, acquisition was significantly different from the model estimate. Furthermore, the SSS curve shape could explain the trend for difference between the model estimate and the posterior MRI measurement (p=0.055). The mean SSS flow rate measured with the posterior acquisition was similar to that reported by Gideon et al. [43]. (443±124 ml/min, p=0.1) and Mehta et al. [44] (388±169 ml/min, p=0.9) on a group of 14 and 15 healthy volunteers, respectively. The model estimate was similar to the cited works. The same reasons could explain why there was a trend for the TS (p=0.09 and p=0.1for the left and the right side, respectively) for slower flow rates measured with MRI compared to that predicted by the model. Another general source of mismatch between our model estimates and the MRI measurements involves the coupled vessels. We assumed a right-left symmetry of the venous network when designing the model, while in vivo asymmetry is described with a wide range of anatomic patterns [45–49]. The IJV, VV, and TS, seem to have right dominance regarding their size and flow [47, 49]. As a matter of principle, different anatomical connections could be additionally implemented with the same approach, even though this would require changing the equations associated to the network. The same model structure can instead be used for a variety of analyses, such as the study of asymmetric vessels, only by changing the dimensions of the vessels. "
653044,2," Venous obstruction simulation The simulations obtained using different combinations of IJV diameters showed that the intracranial pressure is stable for a wide range of IJVs diameters and increases for severe IJV stenosis. Our finding is similar to that showed by the recent model of Gadda [28], where a mild effect on the venous sinuses pressure was produced by halving the IJVs conductances, and a strong effect by setting the IJVs conductances close to zero. The previously cited model analyzed the venous sinuses pressure as a single node of the network. Conversely, our model includes the main intracranial vessels, so we could simulate the pressures at their ends for progressive bilateral IJV constrictions. Even with different amplitudes, the relationship between venous pressure and IJV diameter reduction had the same shape for the different intracranial veins. The high pressures estimated at the confluence of RVs and ICVs to GV due to severe IJVs diameter reduction is a theoretical biomechanical finding supporting the hypothesis and the experimental findings of previous works [20, 50–52]. It has been suggested that such a high pressure can damage the brain tissue, with possible blood–brain-barrier rupture [50, 51] or permeability increase [13, 53]. In particular, since the Galenic system drains the periventricular white matter and the basal ganglia, its increase of pressure can damage those brain areas [51, 53]. The intracranial vein hypertension, especially that of the SSS (Fig. 4b), can also impact the cerebrospinal fluid flow hemodynamics. Indeed, the cerebrospinal fluid flow absorption is possible if cerebrospinal fluid pressure exceeds that of the venous sinuses by about 5–7 mmHg [20]. For severe degrees of IJV stenosis, our model predicted a pressure increase in the SSS similar or even higher than the previously reported pressure gradient. A relationship between IJV stenosis, reflux and cerebrospinal fluid flow alterations was recently observed in different CNS disorders, like MS and AD [13, 14, 20, 54, 55]. The cerebrospinal fluid flow alterations were also recently reported to correlate with “dirty appearing white matter” in healthy subjects [56]. The brain edema seen in cases of venous sinus thrombosis or stenosis could also be due to the decrease in cerebrospinal fluid drainage caused by an increase in venous pressure [57]. In a recent review [20], Beggs explained the link between IJV stenosis, its hypertension and the impairment of cerebrospinal fluid flow absorption into the venous blood. Other consequences of severe neck vein stenoses predicted by our model are the reduced intracranial venous flow rate, and even flow inversion. Schelling in 1986 [52] suggested that refluent IJVs or intracranial veins could produce retrograde venous hypertension, i.e., from downstream to upstream the venous network. The resulting venous overload, engorgement, dilatation and leakage were proposed to be possible causes of MS lesions. The location and shape of such lesions were also suggested to be similar to those found through Schlesinger’s experiments with gelatin solution forced in the GV of human cadavers. With the modelization used in this work, blood flow in any vein is determined by the pressure drop between its extremities, being directed toward the end with the lowest pressure. If the pressure difference between the vein ends reverts, the flow becomes retrograde. This general mechanism explains the cases of reflux found through our simulations, as explained for the intracranial, vertebral and azygos areas hereafter. The upstream of one IJV is more influenced by its diameter change than intracranial vessels: its pressure begins to increase for small IJV diameters reduction. When both the IJVs are stenotic, our model predicted retrograde flow for the intracranial vein proximal to the IJVs themselves, in particular for the CS, IPS and SPS. Figure 5 represents how the flow inversion occurs in the IPSl. The pressures of its two ends were plotted over progressive reductions in IJV diameter (Fig. 5a): since they are superimposed on each other, it is clearly visible when one exceeds the other, i.e., for severe bilateral IJVs stenosis. Together with this pressure drop inversion, the IPSl flow inverted its direction (Fig. 5b). The preferred drainage path of CS, IPS and SPS in this case was the anterior cervical plexus (Fig. 7) instead of the IJVs (Fig. 2), since it offers lower resistance to flow. The presence of collateral vessels, as modeled in this work, did not prevent intracranial pressure increase and reflux. Indeed, one or more collateral vessels in parallel to a stenotic IJV have higher resistance to flow as compared to a patent IJV, even if the total cross sectional area is the same [19]. If a clearer picture was needed, the model could be tuned for a single patient-specific case by setting ad hoc geometry, number, position and connections of collaterals. By doing this, it could be tested how a wider or higher number of collateral vessels would guarantee enough drainage and lower intracranial pressures, avoiding intracranial vessels reflux. Future work involving this kind of simulation could provide a better understanding about how collateral flow impacts intracranial pressure. Indeed, collateral number, dimensions and their anastomosis to the IJV are variable and are fundamental as an alternative pathway in clinical cases of IJV obstruction [27, 28]. The VV morphological obstructions had a low impact on the intracranial region, but a high impact on the pressure of the cervical and vertebral areas, besides on the areas connecting them to the intracranial vessels. When the pressure increase was higher in the upper portion of the VVs than in the intracranial region, a retrograde flow could occur in the posterior occipital sinuses. The blood of the last vessels was redirected to the IJVs instead of flowing to the CPp and VVs. For a patent azygos, the pressure of its distal tracts is higher than that of the proximal ones: this is visible at Fig. 6a, for diameter reduction = 0 %. The flow is directed from its distal to its proximal tracts, to the superior vena cava, as shown in Fig. 2. The simulation of the proximal azygos obstruction produced asevere pressure increase (Fig. 6a, pressure between AZY4 and AZY5 and between AZY5 and AZY6). Conversely, the pressures of the distal districts were almost unaffected by the change (Fig. 6a, pressure between AZY11 and AZY12). When the obstruction caused an excess of pressure in the proximal compared to the distal part of an azygos portion, the pressure gradient changed its direction. The blood flow reverted its physiologic direction according to the pressure gradient. This can be observed in Fig. 6b, which shows how the azygos flow rate changes when proximal azygos obstruction is simulated. The AZY5 flow becomes retrograde when its distal pressure (between AZY5 and AZY6) exceeds the proximal one (between AZY4 and AZY5). For this particular case, this happens when the proximal azygos diameter is halved. The same can be observed for AZY11 flow, with less diameter reduction. A similar mechanism affected the thoracic plexus. The thoracic and azygos refluxes were drained to the right atrium through the inferior vena cava instead of the superior vena cava. "
653044,3," Jugular vein obstructions: comparison of model simulations and real cases Comparing our ECD data with the model estimates in the most prevalent clinical situation (the IJV obstruction), we found agreements in intracranial reflux topography. Comparing our ECD data with the model estimates in the most prevalent clinical situation (the IJV obstruction), we found agreements in intracranial reflux topography. A quantitative comparison could not be done since we did not measure the IJV diameter during ECD acquisitions. However, the results of the model simulations have to be read as a proof of concept: the percentages of IJVs diameter reductions corresponding to intracranial reflux, or to intracranial pressure increase of at least 200 %, are not intended to be considered absolute thresholds. Indeed, they depend on the chosen “normal” IJVs diameter and other vessel dimensions. Regarding venous dimensions, a high inter-subject variability is described in literature, with different physiological vessels dimensions and flow rates among the studies, and a high deviation from the mean within each study [30, 32, 44, 49, 58]. Furthermore, the venous reflux detected in clinical cases often involves only a portion of the vessel and can be intermittent [42]. This fact can be explained by observing the occurrence of separated flow regions in a single vessel, as studied with a Lagrangian approach to fluid flow analysis [59, 60]. Conversely, with the present kind of modelization, a vessel can be classified as refluent if its flow rate is completely reverted. Local flow separation cannot be described through our approach. However, considering the relatively low values of Reynolds' number (maximum = 715 in the SSS), we may reasonably infer that such peculiar flow structures wouldn't significantly affect the vessel resistance calculations in our model. "
653044,4," Limits and perspectives The results of our model and all the simulations provided by it have to be evaluated while taking into consideration the main limitations of our type of modelization: the model is steady-state and it is valid only for analyzing the supine position. Regarding the subject position, a future work for studying a standing subject should consider the effect of atmospheric pressure on IJVs, which collapse, and the role of collateral pathways [28]. As to the steady-state limitation, this means that every pressure and flow of the network is not time-variant, so the modulation of the venous velocity due to the cardiac or the thoracic pump are neglected. A recent work [61] showed that the latter highly influences the venous return of the IJVs, especially for in the deep inspiration, because of the aspiration effect of the pleural cavity. However, the mean flow of the intracranial veins is less modulated by the respiratory phases. The minor effect of respiration and cardiac pulsations on intracranial vein flow was also shown through MRI with the analysis of the frequency components in the range of respiration and heart beat. The flattened flow rate waveform of cerebral sinus veins can be due to their fixed diameter and protective effect of the dura mater [31]. Moreover, the IJV cross sectional area changes over the cardiac cycle [62]. However, due to the high inter-subject variability in terms of IJV cross sectional areas and ranges of variation, the choice of considering an average constant value can be considered a reasonable approximation. Another aspect to point out is that the refluxes observed in clinical cases could be due to the sum of the effects of many morphological alterations (i.e., other abnormalities besides IJV or VV or AZY obstruction), while we separately simulated the effects of the main routes obstruction, obtaining intracranial refluxes only for severe IJV stenoses. Nonetheless, it is possible to use this model to test the effect of many other morphological alterations. Owing to the linearity of the model, the effects of any combination of anatomical changes may be obtained through the superposition principle, i.e., by linearly combining the effects of single anatomical alterations. It is hence straightforward to adapt the model to patient-specific features."
654927,0," This is the first multimodal imaging study in which 2 noninvasive and 2 invasive diagnostic techniques for the detection of extracranial venous anomalies, indicative of CCSVI were applied. The main finding of the study is that invasive techniques confirmed that noninvasive DS screening was a reliable approach for identifying patients eligible for further multimodal invasive imaging testing of the IJVs. In 19 of the 20 MS patients, the extracranial venous IJV anomalies indicative of CCSVI diagnosis were confirmed on CV or IVUS. However, it has to be noted that 50% of the screened MS population did not fulfill ≥2 extracranial VH DS criteria and were therefore not eligible to undergo invasive testing, which limited the study ability to investigate specificity of DS vs. invasive imaging diagnostic techniques. Nevertheless, the findings from this multimodal study are important, as they suggests that DS can be used reliably to select those patients who may present extracranial IJV venous anomalies, indicative of CCSVI, while in the same time, it can potentially exclude those patients who should not undergo an invasive testing of the IJVs. However, the noninvasive screening methods were inadequate to depict the total amount of VV anomalies that would indirectly reflect the pathology of the azygos vein identified with invasive testing. These findings are related to the fact that we were not able to directly non-invasively assess the azygos vein. In our opinion and experience [6, 8, 22, 23], there are no reliable, non-invasive imaging modalities at this time that would directly image the azygous vein in vivo. Another important finding is related to the results from the invasive portion of the study, which confirmed the existence of severe extracranial venous anomalies, indicative of CCSVI that significantly impaired blood outflow from the brain. "
654927,1," A growing body of evidence suggests that the majority of CCSVI pathology is confined to the intra-luminal portion of extracranial veins, which requires high-resolution DS or IVUS B-mode imaging for the visualization of these anomalies [8, 26, 27]. It has been shown that the presence and number of these anomalies may contribute to a higher number of collateral neck veins and functional abnormalities [8, 27]. While CV is considered to be ""the gold standard - benchmark"" for detecting stenosis in blood vessels associated with altered blood flow, the PREMiSe study showed that CV may not be sensitive enough to reveal the exact nature of narrowed vein segments [25]. CV is a luminogram and brings little or no data regarding the vessel's intra-luminal structures because of dense opacification of the lumen with contrast, which obliterates subtle intra-luminal structures [19]. There are no consensus guidelines with respect to the use of angiographic contrast for extrcranial CV examination [28]. The recent position statement of the International Society for Neurovascular Disease on the use of angiographic contrast for the assessment of IJVs and the azygos vein on CV does not provide clear guidelines on this issue [29]. Angiographic contrast may be used diluted (1:1) or non-diluted. While the diluted contrast may allow a better visualization of endoluminal structures (valve leaflets, webs, etc.) non-diluted contrast allows a better opacification of epidural and other collaterals, as well as a better estimation of overall features of the veins [28]. In the PREMiSe study, non-diluted contrast was used. It could be that use of a diluted contrast could have produced different findings. The PREMiSe study also demonstrated the advantage of IVUS compared to CV in detecting intra-luminal abnormalities as well as the importance of including IVUS during CV examination, especially for the assessment of the azygos vein [25]. It is important to note that sensitivity of IVUS to depict extracranial venous anomalies on DS, indicative of CCSVI, was in better agreement than the CV findings, especially for the azygos vein/VVs territory. However, one of the important limitations of DS screening approach is that the azygos vein cannot be directly imaged. While the sensitivity for detecting VV anomalies on IVUS vs. DS was high, DS did not detect abnormal VV flow in 10 patients who had positive IVUS in the azygos vein. Similar limitations were observed for MRV. These results suggest that currently, available noninvasive indirect screening methods are inadequate in depicting the total amount of intra-luminal pathology of the azygos vein. The sensitivity of CV + IVUS to define total IJV pathology on DS was 100%. These findings support results from the 2 previous studies in which a higher sensitivity of DS to detect extracranial anomalies on IVUS compared to CV was found in the IJVs [27, 30]. These results can also explain findings from some recent reports that found low correspondence between the DS screening assessment and the CV findings [9, 31]. "
654927,2," Zamboni et al. proposed a set of 5 VH DS criteria by which MS patients were differentiated from healthy controls with 100% specificity and sensitivity. While the original publication did not provide the exact technical procedures for the protocol application in either a research or routine clinical setting, there were recent attempts to define the standardized CCSVI DS scanning protocol [5, 32, 33]. These revised DS protocols propose the use of quantitative measures for the definition of functional anomalies such as blood flow velocity and volume that could be potentially more reliable in assessing the degree of venous outflow obstruction in the extracranial venous system [32, 33]. They also refine originally proposed VH criteria [5, 32, 34] and propose the use of the central blinded DS reading [33]. In this multimodal comparison of different noninvasive and invasive imaging techniques in phase 2 of the PREMiSe study, we read findings from multimodal techniques in a blinded manner by different experts and using a panel to reach a consensus when there were discrepancies by the readers. They also confirmed the correctness of the exam reading by a-priori comparing un-blinded reading results of the individual imaging modalities on a subject level. We did not consider the assessment of the second CCSVI VH criterion (reflux in deep cerebral veins) for several reasons: 1) the reproducibility of this criterion is lower compared to the other 4 VH criteria; [6, 7] 2) there is no direct anatomical extracranial correlate for performing sensitivity and specificity comparisons with other multimodal imaging techniques; 3) use of this criterion contributes to the highest variability in making a CCSVI diagnosis and 4) the direction of the blood flow in veins connecting cortical with deep veins may vary considerably as a consequence of the physiologic inter-individual variation of the cerebral venous anatomy [11]. Despite this, the results of the multimodal PREMiSe study further support the value of DS VH criteria for the screening of extracranial venous anomalies in territories of left and right IJVs. "
654927,3," When CV + IVUS findings were compared to MRV findings, sensitivity was high but the specificity was low, confirming our previous results [23, 24]. Some other investigators used a slightly different grading system for the detection of extracranial venous anomalies on MRV and found similar sensitivity but better specificity compared to CV [35]. Therefore, the use of different MRV evaluation criteria may have yielded different sensitivity and specificity results compared to CV, IVUS and DS in the PREMiSe study. While there is still a lack of standardized guidelines for the detection of extracranial venous anomalies indicative of CCSVI on MRV, the findings from the PREMiSe study indicate that MRV should be incorporated in the armentorium of noninvasive screening techniques. Further work is needed to standardize MRV morphology criteria [6, 22–24, 35–37] and incorporate flow and velocity information in determining subjects at risk for the detection of extracranial venous outflow anomalies with hemodynamic consequences [38–40]. "
654927,4," The combination of DS + MRV did not yield better reliability vs. invasive imaging techniques compared to the DS alone. However, phase 2 of the PREMiSe study included only MS patients with ≥2 VH extracranial criteria, which limited our ability to explore the additive value of MRV to DS in improving sensitivity and specificity vs. other invasive imaging techniques. "
654927,5," It was proposed that extracranial venous collateral circulation is a compensatory mechanism for impaired venous outflow because it bypasses blocked veins and thereby reduces resistance to drainage [6, 8, 41]. The PREMiSe study showed an excellent correspondence between identifying collateral veins on MRV and CV. Approximately, 70%-85% of patients presented collateral veins on the right and 75%-80% on the left side of IJV on MRV and CV respectively. In addition, 80% of patients presented with collaterals of the azygos vein on CV. These findings confirm that the presence of collaterals on MRV and CV may represent an indirect compensatory mechanism for impaired venous outflow. In the previous study, we found high specificity for distinguishing MS vs. healthy controls based on >1 of collateral veins in the neck [6]. "
654927,6," PREMiSe was an endovascular angioplasty study that did not include healthy controls or MS patients without the presence of CCSVI diagnosis on DS. This selection bias of the included population was an important limitation of this diagnostic study, as the sensitivity and specificity findings of noninvasive vs. invasive techniques cannot be generalized to the prevalence of findings to other case–control studies. However, the main aim of this multimodal study was to define and reliably detect extracranial venous anomalies, indicative of CCSVI in the IJVs and azygos vein/VVs of patients using DS and to confirm the presence of these anomalies by using 2 invasive imaging techniques. Another potential limitation of the study is a relatively small sample size, which could skew our findings. Although PREMiSe was a limited pilot trial not powered to detect the prevalence of CCSVI in the general MS population and healthy individuals, it confirmed a general prevalence of extracranial venous anomalies, indicative of CCSVI that we have reported in large cohorts using DS and MRV [5, 6, 8, 22]. "
654927,7," Maybe the most important result of the PREMiSe study is that our multimodal imaging findings contradict the number of recent DS studies that reported a prevalence of CCSVI <10% in MS patients [9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 33, 42–44]. In fact, the invasive diagnostic portion of PREMiSe confirmed that 19 of the 20 MS patients screened as CCSVI positive by DS had severe impairment of extracranial venous outflow with significant stenosis in the IJVs and azygos veins. Future, larger, case-controlled, multicenter, multimodal, noninvasive and invasive imaging studies that will include healthy controls, MS patients and patients with other neurological diseases should determine the real prevalence of CCSVI in these cohorts."
432103,0," Amoebae are good candidates to be a reservoir of the elusive M. ulcerans, but this relationship has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Here, we study the potential for amoebae to host M. ulcerans both experimentally as by sampling an aquatic environment. Our results show that M. ulcerans can indeed be phagocytosed in vitro by A. polyphaga and that viable bacilli persist for at least 2 weeks. We observed both tight and spacious phagosomal vacuoles containing M. ulcerans in infected A. polyphaga with transmission electron microscopy, as has been described for M. avium-infected A. [29,47] and for macrophages infected with mycobacteria [50], including M. ulcerans [51]. The observed reduction in the number of viable bacilli is probably due to bacilli that are expelled by the amoebae after a phase of intracellular multiplication, as has been reported for in vitro mycobacteria-infected macrophages [52,53]. The kanamycin in the medium therefore probably killed released bacteria and resulted in an underestimation of the capacity of M. ulcerans to grow inside the protozoan cells. Compared to a noninfected A. polyphaga monolayer, infection with the M. ulcerans strains did not result in a higher loss of cells (data not shown) indicating that the infection did not affect A. polyphaga viability. "
432103,1," By analysing samples from an aquatic environment in BU endemic and nearby non-endemic communities in southern Ghana, we found several mycobacterium species intracellularly in eukaryotic micro-organisms. Most of the mycobacterium species we identified are potentially pathogenic to humans [54–57]. We did not isolate M. ulcerans, even not by successively passaging IS2404 positive specimens and amoeba cultures in mouse footpads, the method that has led to the only successful isolation of M. ulcerans from the environment [15] (data not shown). We isolated mycobacteria as frequently from an intracellular source as free-living, suggesting that it is quite common for several species of mycobacteria to infect micro-organisms in natural circumstances. The intracellular lifestyle was found significantly more frequent in detritus samples compared to water and biofilm samples. This could be due to the low oxygen levels in this organic debris. For several environmental bacteria (including M. avium) it has been shown that oxygen depletion (and other conditions that typically dominate in animal intestines) triggers the invasion of and enhances the survival within host cells [58,59]. "
432103,2," We detected the marker IS2404 in 1 water and 2 biofilm samples collected in a BU endemic and a nearby non-endemic community in southern Ghana. In addition, we detected the same marker in 6 amoeba cultures obtained from other samples. This is the first report of the detection of the marker IS2404, suggestive of M. ulcerans presence, in amoeba cultures isolated from the environment. It is noticeable that we tripled our detection frequency of IS2404 by searching in the amoeba cultures in addition to the original samples. We could not observe AFB in the smears of these amoeba cultures, but one must take into account that M. ulcerans and other IS2404 containing mycobacteria grow very slowly and thus were probably present in very low quantities on the amoeba cultures. On LJ-medium, M. ulcerans colonies only appear after an average of 10 weeks in primary culture from clinical specimens [60]. From environmental sources, M. ulcerans was only isolated once despite numerous attempts [15]. "
432103,3," Other mycobacteria were also quite frequently detected in amoeba cultures (in 17.5%), by a PCR assay targeting their 16S- rRNA gene. For these, mycobacterial presence could be confirmed by microscopy in almost half of the positive cultures. However, the AFB were not observed inside or attached to the amoebae. The fact that in our study mycobacteria could still be detected after multiple subcultures of the amoeba cultures, suggests that the mycobacteria were multiplying extracellularly on the agar plates. IS2404 was in fact also detected on one agar plate on which the amoebae did not survive subculturing. Similarly, in a co-culture study of M. avium and A. polyphaga, M. avium was shown to persist and multiply both intracellularly and extracellularly as a sapro- phyte on the excrement of A. polyphaga, and mycobacterial growth was most extensive extracellularly [47]. "
432103,4," The successful uptake and persistence of M. ulcerans inside A. polyphaga in vitro and the higher detection frequency of IS2404 in amoeba cultures as opposed to the crude samples from the environment suggest that amoebae may act as a host for M. ulcerans in natural circumstances. However, our data do not reveal a significant role for protozoa in the distribution patterns of BU disease in humans, so we remain sceptical about their involvement in the direct transmission of M. ulcerans to humans. If a protozoan were to be principally responsible for the observed distribution pattern of BU in humans, one would expect either a particular species with a limited distribution to harbour M. ulcerans, or otherwise several species that only do so in areas where BU actually occurs in humans. In this study, however, we detected IS2404 as frequently in amoeba cultures isolated from BU endemic as from non-BU endemic communities. Moreover, 5 different protozoan species from two divergent families were identified in the IS2404 positive amoeba cultures, some of which are known to be cosmopolitan. On the other hand, we cannot completely rule out that some or all of the IS2404 we detected originated from different mycobacterial species than M. ulcerans. "
432103,5," More environmental research is needed in Africa if we want to understand the distribution of BU, and to prevent its transmission from the environment to humans. Environmental research of M. ulcerans has been severely hampered by the difficulties of detecting the pathogen in the environment. Our results indicate that perhaps amoeba cultures can serve for improved detection of M. ulcerans in environmental samples. Co-cultivation with an existing amoeba culture is a technique to selectively isolate amoebae- resistant bacteria that are difficult to grow from the environment [61] and has already been proven successful in the identification of new pathogens and their distribution patterns [62]."
2442696,0," The idea of venous congestion as a possible contributor to pathogenesis of MS has been discussed for the past 40 years, but remained widely unappreciated by the scientific community [3]–[4], [6,26]. Until recently, no scientific attempt was undertaken to prove or disprove the hypothesis despite its potential therapeutic implications. Therefore, the exceptionally significant results presented by Zamboni et al generated extraordinary interest and controversy in both scientific and social communities [27]. According to the Author, CCSVI may play a significant role in MS etiology by means of a venous congestion and an impairment of iron accumulation [28]. Several repetition studies did not reach the same strict evidences and the reliability of the CCSVI-MS association has already been debated [5]–[7]. Moreover, proposed parameters from Zamboni et al has been considered questionable by some Authors [5,29]. “A swan song for CCSVI” has been sung by two recent large and unbiased studies that suggests no association of CCSVI to MS [7]–[9]. Nevertheless, some haemodynamic alterations of venous system in MS patients may represent a functional epiphenomenon of intracranial microvascular impairment. Despite a slight difference in global CBF e CFV between MS patients and HCs, basal arterial and venous haemodynamic features did not differ among groups. The results of this study suggested such an impairment of postural control of both arterial inflow and venous outflow in MS patients without affecting CCP and CVR to apnea. As suggested by Gonul et al, arterial response to postural variation is a reliable method to assess cerebral autoregulation and may depend on autonomic and neurocardiogenic control systems of cerebral perfusion [18]. Several studies observed an orthostatic intolerance in MS patients but the pathophysiological mechanisms has not been elucidated and the relationship with disease severity and progression is still an object of debate [30]–[34]. Since significant changes of non invasively measured MAP and HR in sitting position has not been observed in our series, an impairment of cerebral microvasculature may be suggested but the preserved endothelial-dependent cerebral autoregulation did not support this hypothesis. Moreover, CPP remains stable after 90 s of sitting position and no differences has been found between MS patients and HCs. In addition, postural adaptation of MFVs was not different among sex, age or disease duration groups while a significant association has been observed with clinical disability. More sympathetic rather than parasympathetic dysfunction appears early in the course of MS and correlates with disease progression and MS clinical disability [35], [36]. A noradrenergic dysfunction may determine an altered vasoconstriction that would explain the reduced postural control of arterial inflow independently from changes in arterial blood pressure (ABP) [37]. The same sympathetic impairment could increase venomotor tone with resulting abnormal compliance of venous vessel wall [30]. Although we did not observed significant differences in global CVF between patients and controls, an altered postural control of venous outflow was more prevalent in MS patients, particularly in PP phenotype and in more disabled patients. According to Monti et al, such an explanation may be a no efficient Spinal Epidural Veins outflow as an additional drainage pathway in the seated position [38]. However, the cerebral venous system has more anatomical variability than the intracranial system and is often asymmetrical. The IJVs are the prevalent extracranial outflow pathways in the supine position while redirection of venous blood flow towards the vertebral veins occurs in the upright position [17,22]. In this study, a significant prevalence of right IJV in supine position and no alteration in available intracranial veins have been observed in line with previous findings [22,39,40]. Nevertheless, we did not find any association among anatomical variability, positive ΔCSA and loss of postural venous drainage control. Therefore, any pathology (stenosis) affecting cranio-cervical or azygous venous system such as a IJV's valve incompetence seems not sustainable. Some methodological issues need to be stressed at this point. First, the patients reached head upright in sitting position on a tilting chair and not on a tilt bed assuming a constant MCA diameter. Second, the angle of insonation may change during head up tilt and could adversely affect the results. Furthermore, this is a single cross-sectional centre study with a single trained sonographer. Although patients with recent relapse or treated with corticosteroids have been excluded, the relative impact of disease progression and disease-modifying treatments are not exhaustively elucidated. As a matter of fact, despite several attempts of standardization, ultrasonographic techniques are operator-dependent and this is particularly true for venous assessment because of a wide anatomical and physiological variability of venous system and a high bias due to manual pressure. In addition, the interpretation of extracranial and intracranial venous studies is hampered by the fact that the interobserver and intra-observer reliability of the method is still variable [41]. On the contrary, the strength of this study is a meticulous blinded design and a relatively good sample size with a high percentage of PP-MS patients and a large amount of measured haemodynamic parameters. Considering RR-MS and PP-MS as two clinical opposites of the same disease, we excluded SP-MS patients in order to avoid possible confounding factors. "
2442696,1," In conclusion, our study suggested that the quantitative evaluation of CBF and CVF and their postural dependency may be related to a dysfunction of autonomic nervous system that seems to characterize more disabled MS patients. It's not clear whether the altered postural control of arterial inflow and venous outflow is a specific MS condition or simply represents an “epiphenomenon” of neurodegenerative events. Further studies correlating ultrasonographic hemodynamic data with MR imaging lesion load and with perfusional parameters are needed in order to confirm our hypothesis."
1150,0," We explored the correlation between the distribution of Belostomatidae and Naucoridae and the prevalence of Buruli ulcer. We have found a positive gradient between habitat suitability of Naucoridae and Belostomatidae and Buruli ulcer prevalence. Correlation does not imply caus- ation; this result is not proof that the insects are vectors. However, understanding the reasons for the temporal and spatial changes in this correlation will enable a better understanding of the reasons for changes in Buruli ulcer prevalence. "
1150,1," There are significant temporal changes in this correlation between habitat suitability of the insects and Buruli ulcer prevalence; in Akonolinga the Buruli ulcer prevalence is correlated to Naucoridae and Belostomatidae distribution in the wet season, but not in the dry season. Buruli ulcer is known to have complex temporal changes in prevalence [30,33,34], as is M. ulcerans [14,35]. It is therefore unsur- prising that, if these insects are implicated in maintaining M. ulcerans in the environment, or involved in transmis- sion to humans in some way (either as host vectors, or host carriers), the correlation between Buruli ulcer preva- lence and their abundance would change in time. "
1150,2," We also observe spatial changes in the correlation; water bug habitat suitability is not correlated to Buruli ulcer prevalence in Bankim, 457 km North of Akonolinga. Speculatively, perhaps other routes of transmission may be more important in this region, for example contact with infected plant biofilms, as suggested in Ghana [36]. "
1150,3," How do we interpret this result in terms of the Bradford-Hill guidelines? Herein we have focused on the correlation between these insects and the prevalence of the disease in both space and time. While there is a sig- nificant positive correlation for the predicted abundance of the aquatic insects and the prevalence of the Buruli ulcer, this correlation is not consistent from region to re- gion. Previous research has proposed that M. ulcerans is transmitted within a multi-host transmission network [4]. In such a situation of multiple hosts the relative im- portance of any given mode of transmission may be ex- pected to vary in time or space, and our results are consistent with, though not proof of, this hypothesis. The lack of a clear signal between water bugs and Buruli ulcer in Bankim would suggest that may not be key vectors or host carriers in that region. Recent studies have found notable changes in community composition relevant to M. ulcerans distribution, in the Greater Accra, Ashanti and Volta regions of Ghana, for both plant [35] and aquatic insects [37]. This would support the importance of changing biotic communities as a key factor in changing Buruli ulcer prevalence, a priority for future work. We have found that the prevalence of Buruli ulcer is correlated to Belostomatidae and Naucoridae abundance in Akonolinga but not Bankim, we do not know if the plant community composition for these re- gions, and wider aquatic insect community, also correlates to disease prevalence changes on a similar scale. "
1150,4," The ecological niches of both Naucorid and Belostomatid water bugs in West Africa are predominantly determined by the distribution of suitable landcover in a 5 km radius, preferring water bodies, artificial areas and rain fed crop- lands. The specific land cover at the point of the site (GLC-AP) was less informative. The observation that the most suitable regional land cover class is water bodies is not surprising, but the high suitability of urban areas is curious. Ecologically this could have a variety of causes; there may be changes in the chemical composition of water in these habitats, a reduction in predation pressure, or a greater abundance of food. The specific reasons will require further research. "
1150,5," Our study has been limited in certain points; the low taxonomic resolution of the insects is a current limita- tion in this study. Secondly, an important limitation is that the distribution of M. ulcerans in these insects in these areas is unknown. The distribution of Naucoridae and Belostomatidae infected by M. ulcerans may differ from the distribution of Naucoridae and Belostomatidae generally. However, the insects are known to host the bacillus on their carapace, in their body [10,14,16]) and in their salivary glands [14] in the wild, and the distribu- tion of the insect necessarily sets a limit to the distri- bution of infected insects. A related limitation is the unknown incubation time of M. ulcerans; the time from infection to presentation at the hospital, remains un- known. Finally, we have only addressed a single criterion of the Bradford-Hill guidelines; correlation. We have not aimed for a full discussion of the other criteria, and our findings should not be interpreted as proof of the role of these insects as vectors or key host carriers. Rather, we have discussed the existence of, and change in, a correl- ation between these insects and Buruli ulcer. Future work aims to explore spatial variation in the correlation between Buruli ulcer and the entire plant and animal communities, identifying any similarities between re- gions where the correlation exists, expanding on previ- ous studies [37] which have focused on the community assemblage differences between M. ulcerans endemic and non-endemic regions of Ghana. "
1150,6," Despite these limitations, these results are consistent with previous research, which has shown that in Akonolinga the Nyong river is a risk factor for Buruli ulcer [30]. Our results agree with this conclusion; the main focus of suit- able habitats for the insects in Akonolinga is the Nyong river, where the existence of large plants near the river banks provides appropriate habitat for Naucoridae and Belostomatidae to forage, develop and reproduce. Previous research has also implicated aquatic insects as important including detection of M. vectors in Akonolinga [14], ulcerans in the saliva of the insects. "
1150,7," In conclusion, we find a positive correlation between the abundance of Naucoridae and Belostomatidae suitable habitat and Buruli ulcer prevalence. This correlation is not constant, and changes in time and space. We interpret this as evidence consistent with that idea that Naucoridae and Belostomatidae may be locally important host carriers of M. ulcerans in certain conditions, their importance chan- ging as the environmental conditions change, which would be expected in the situation of multi-host transmission."
1287608,0," This study tested the CCSVI hypothesis with three complementary imaging techniques (US, 4D flow MRI, and CE-MRV) in a large cohort of MS patients and age- and sex-matched controls, including HCs and subjects with other neurological disease. Our study was designed to address limitations of small sample sizes and single modality assessment found in other CCSVI investigations.4–26 To our knowledge, this is the only study that provides a comprehensive assessment of blood flow and luminography using 4D flow MRI in three cerebrospinal venous regions (totaling 14 measurement locations of blood flow), CE-MRV for semiquantitative assessment of vessels in both the IJV and AV, and strictly blinded US exams performed according to Zamboni’s CCSVI criteria.5 "
1287608,1," Without question, the CCSVI hypothesis has led to renewed interest in both intra- and extracranial venous flow measurements, namely in the DCVs, the IJVs, and the AV. From an imaging perspective, venous flow assessment for CCSVI is problematic. First, unlike rigid and muscular arteries, veins have thin, nonmuscular walls that make for an easily compressible and distensible lumen. Hence, veins are highly variable in appearance on cross-sectional imaging, which substantially compromises the test–retest and inter-rater reliability of venous caliber measurements on CE-MRV exams.33 Such variability is especially evident in IJVs which can take a number of different cross-sectional configurations (pinpoint, crescentic, flattened, oblong, etc.). Additionally, unlike stenotic arterial flow jets, a collapsing vein may produce slow flow or even flow reversal. In B-mode US images of IJVs, which are inherently 2D projections, this may lead to over- or under-estimation of lumen size, depending on the vessel shape and transducer direction. Underestimation may also occur if the ultrasonographer uses too much transducer pressure, collapsing the vein. Second, venous flow velocity (within a volume) is sensitive to a number of variables including body position,34 head position or rotation,35 respiratory state,36,37 hydration level,38 diurnal changes, and caffeine intake. Finally, the DCVs of interest in CCSVI—which include the internal cerebral and basal veins—are small and located in areas that are often difficult to assess. In flow MRI, this translates to a need for higher resolution scans and careful correction of phase offsets and displacement artifacts that lead to flow measurement errors. The problem is even more vexing in transcranial Doppler US due to the small or nonexistent temporal acoustic window (roughly 10% of individuals have no acoustic window),39 the variability of operator skill, and the inherent methodological problem adequately blinding technicians to subject status. Many of these criticisms relative to Zamboni’s original diagnosis of CCSVI using US (and the subsequent endovascular treatment) have been examined in more detail previously.40 "
1287608,2," In general, MRI has several benefits compared with US: MRI is the standard-of-care modality for diagnosis of MS, it is less operator dependent and is conducted according to prospective protocols that can be faithfully repeated by fully blinded operators, and it can be used to noninvasively assess vessels inaccessible to US. Drawbacks of MRI include image acquisition is not real time, ECG-gated acquisitions last several cardiac cycles, and measurements can only be made in the supine position, precluding the assessment of positional flow changes.3 "
1287608,3," PC-VIPR29,30 is a particularly powerful technique for flow assessment that utilizes a 3D, time-resolved radial acquisition k-space trajectory. This technique provides several advantages for assessing CCSVI beyond other MRI methods that measure blood flow. First, PC-VIPR is a 3D technique that covers an extensive anatomical volume with high isotropic spatial resolution, allowing entire vascular territories to be rendered during a single scan. Second, compared to a standard 3D Cartesian sampling scheme, the radial acquisition, in which central k-space is oversampled and outer portions of k-space are undersampled, allows for faster acquisition and high temporal resolution. This in turn creates high image contrast and sparse signal representation with background suppression. Finally, the artifacts associated with PC-VIPR do not substantially compromise the images. "
1287608,4," In summary, each imaging technique used in this study has its own strengths and weaknesses, and therefore provides complementary information on cerebrospinal venous vasculature. B-mode and Doppler US provides high temporal resolution and allows for strict adherence to Zamboni’s CCSVI criteria. The inherent 2D nature of US, however, may cause over- or underestimation of cross-sectional area. Further, it is impossible to interrogate the entire cerebrospinal venous system. 3D MRI techniques are more easily blinded and do not have these limitations. CE-MRV provides excellent high-resolution visualization of venous structures. This method acquires results at a single time point and thus may fail to capture potential respiratory or cardiac-induced change. Further, there are currently no established standards for normal venous lumen caliber.15,24 Without such standards, inter-rater agreement measures are unlikely to be high. PC-VIPR provides dynamic measurement of 3D velocities in a large volume with high spatial resolution; however, unexpectedly low velocities may result in poor signal-to-noise ratio and potentially compromise flow measurements. "
1287608,5," With 4D flow MRI (PC-VIPR), there were no statistically significant differences observed between groups (or age- and sex-matched pairs) for any flow measurement, at any anatomical location. Concordant with other IJV flow studies,6,25,33 larger total flow values are seen for the right IJV compared with the left IJV across all groups. However, large standard deviations are also observed, which possibly stemmed from the grouping of varying age and gender for group comparisons. This grouping encompassed a wide range of participant ages (MS: 19–68 years, HCs: 23–74 years, other neurological disease: 22–68 years) and a higher number of women than men (MS: 49F/27M; HCs: 31F/22; other neurological disease: 29F/14M). At baseline, IJV flow measurements are extremely variable. Individual cerebrospinal venous flow measurements are known to be subject to several normal day-to-day variations, such as related to body position,34 head position,35 and hydration levels.38 Previous work has shown these day-to-day flow changes to be as high as 20%, even while demonstrating good technical reproducibility in cerebrospinal venous vasculature measurements using PC-VIPR.33 A previous study using US and CE-MRV in MS patients suggests CE-MRV provides a more robust assessment of IJV narrowing than B-mode US, which can be limited by operator skill and misleading 2D projections.41 Scoring of the CE-MRV analysis indicated good image quality for both the IJV and AV, with particularly high values for the IJV. Although CE-MRV in the chest was performed during a single breath hold, the images are not cardiac resolved. This cardiac motion likely caused the lower image quality seen for the AVs compared with the IJV. Despite good image quality, CE-MRV results from this study differ from previous work concerning extracranial venous scoring24 in which IJV caliber was assessed using a linearly increasing flattening scale. Our semiquantitative approach to venous lumen morphology has precedence15 but may have made consistent scoring problematic, and resulted in moderate (IJV) and poor (AV) interobserver agreement. That said, no significant differences in scoring were observed between subject groups for either scorer. "
1287608,6," Our US studies found that 15.8% of MS patients met at least two CCSVI criteria, but so did a nearly equal percentage of HC subjects (17.0%). These findings are in concert with published CCSVI studies using Doppler and B-mode US which reported high heterogeneity in CCSVI diagnosis (≥2 criteria met). Across the studies listed in Table 1 (excluding Zamboni et al. studies3–5), the percentage of all patients with MS who met criteria range from 06,9,11,18 to 84%23 (across all studies average ± stdev = 20.9 ± 27.6%). The percentage of all HC subjects who met criteria range from 06,9,18,19,23,26 to 45.0%20 (average ± stdev = 9.9 ± 16.0%). Our findings further highlight the high variability in venous anatomy and physiology across subject groups. "
1287608,7," There were relatively equal percentages of subjects who met CCSVI criteria by US and MR. However, US seems to be a more conservative measure of IJV stenosis; lower percentages of subjects were found to have IJV stenosis by US than by either MRI measurement. Results across all subjects suggest that some small amount of reflux in the cerebrospinal venous system exists in both a normal population and MS patients, and that there is no significant difference in the percentage of these groups exhibiting reflux. "
1287608,8," In conclusion, our study demonstrates no significant relationship between MS and IJV stenosis and abnormal flow. We found no difference between subjects with MS and those with other neurological disease, or HC subjects, with regard to venous anatomy and physiology, irrespective of imaging modality. Our results indicate that the CCSVI hypothesis is not strongly explanatory as a cause of MS."
1128341,0," The demographic history of a pathogen population leaves a “signature” in the genomes of modern representatives of that population (18). Reconstructing this history allows us to gain valuable insights into the processes that drove past population dynamics (25). We recognized temporal parallels between the mycobacterial popula- tion dynamics and the timing of health policy changes managing the BU epidemic in the Songololo territory (Fig. 4). The mycobacterial population size increased in the territory during a period of decreased attention to BU that resulted in the loss of specialized personnel. After the start of a national BU program and the implementation of free-of-charge treatment, a strong increase was noted in the number of admitted BU cases which concorded with a detected inﬂection—perhaps a small drop— of the mycobacterial population size. These observations suggest that control strategies at the public health level may have decreased the size of the human M. ulcerans reservoir and that this reservoir is important in sustaining new infections. This hypothesis predicts that even if other environmental reservoirs exist, the number of M. ulcerans infections will decrease if only human cases are treated. "
1128341,1," The M. ulcerans phylogeography revealed one almost exclusively predominant sublineage of Mu_A1 that arose in Central Africa and proliferated in the different foci of endemicity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, and The Republic of the Congo during the Age of Discovery (15th to 18th centuries). The principal sublin- eage of Mu_A1 was introduced into the Songololo territory around 1865 (95% HPD, 1803 to 1915), and over the subsequent century (1865 to 1974), it established itself and evolved in six distinct groups across the territory. This timing is consistent with in-depth interviews with former patients and observations of healed lesions that suggested that M. ulcerans infections already occurred in the Songololo territory in 1935 and probably even earlier (22). The genome-based time tree of Central African M. ulcerans thus revealed that the Songololo territory became an area of endemicity while the region was being colonized by Belgium (1880s). Early during the Belgian occupation, the Songololo territory was developed heavily to link the oceanic harbor of Matadi by rail with Kinshasa, where the Congo River becomes navigable, opening up the entire interior of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for economic exploitation (26). The Songololo territory was already inhabited long before the arrival of the European colonizers. The Kongo people are believed to have settled at the mouth of the Congo River before 500 BCE (before the Common Era), as part of the larger Bantu migration (27). However, our data reveal that it was only after the start of colonial rule that the epidemic Songololo M. ulcerans clone was introduced, possibly through the arrival of displaced BU-infected humans or as a consequence of the substantial environmental changes brought by the Belgian occupation of the Songololo territory. "
1128341,2," Similarly to recent studies that used comparative genomics to investigate the microevolution of M. ulcerans during its establishment in a continent (11) or region (13, 16), the genotypes in Central Africa show strong spatial segregation (Fig. 2). This was illustrated by the regional clustering of M. ulcerans from the different endemic BU foci (e.g., Songololo and Tshela) within the phylogenies. This clustering of cases within foci of endemicity reﬂects a common source of infection within the disease focus. These repeated ﬁndings indicate that when M. ulcerans is introduced in a particular area, it remains isolated, resulting in a localized clonal expansion associated with that area. An inspection of the time tree showed that a clonal complex associated with a focus of endemicity often has been pervasive in that region for a considerable time; in the case of Songololo, for around 150 years. Even within the Songololo territory, we observed that the separated eastern Kimpese health area (tMCRA [BAPS-1], 1941) and western Nsona-Pangu health area (tMCRA [BAPS-2], 1922) groups have most likely remained segregated over a timespan of half a century, indicating that M. ulcerans spreads relatively slowly between neighboring regions. This also indicates that environmental reservoirs of the mycobacterium in that region had to remain localized and relatively isolated. "
1128341,3," Unlike the larger geographic scale data, at smaller geographical scales, genotypes start to co-occur. First, four Songololo BAPS groups were found to be cocirculating. Moreover, we observed completely identical genomes originating from patients living in villages separated by distances of on average 17 km, similar to the ﬁndings of recent studies (13, 14). We believe the observed “breakup” of the focal distribution pattern at smaller geographical scales can be explained by the determined low substitution rate that corresponds to the accumulation of just 0.23 SNPs per bacterial chromosome per year. The slow substitution rate severely limits the accumulation of point mutations and as such, lowers the resolving power of the genomes. This explains why (in the most extreme case), over a period of 5 years, identical genomes were discovered in three patients who lived in three different villages separated by 26 km: insufﬁcient time has elapsed for point mutations to accumulate. "
1128341,4," Finally, an old debate relating to the role of Angolan refugees on a resurge of BU in the Songololo territory (24) can be settled. As most of these refugees had already lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for several years before their diagnosis, and as some young Angolan BU patients were even born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo without even having visited Angola, an introduction from Angola was already believed to be unlikely. Now, an analysis of our phylogenies shows that no typical Angolan genotypes were detected in Songololo, indicating that the refugees were in all likelihood infected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. "
1128341,5," In conclusion, in the present study, we used both temporal associations and the study of the mycobacterial demographic history in a focus of endemicity to implicate human-induced changes and activities over (recent) historical scales behind the spread of BU in Central Africa. We propose that patients with infected discharging BU lesions can contaminate slow-ﬂowing riparian and lentic environments through activities involving water contact and that these patients can constitute an important means of bacterial spread. A total of 74% of BU patients identiﬁed during a cross-sectional study (28) of the Songololo territory had ulcerative lesions (49% category I, 31% category II, and 20% category III), indicating that a high percentage of patients might be shedding bacteria into the environment and potentially indirectly infecting others. We suggest that in BU-affected areas, chains of transmission can be broken and the spread of disease stopped through improved disease surveillance, resulting in treatment during the preulcerative onset of the infection. This view is supported by the decline of BU incidence recorded in some regions of endemicity which proﬁted from such enhanced active surveillance practices (29)."
432129,0," Despite the great health and socio-economic burden borne by people affected with BU, little is known about the ecology and mode of transmission of this disease. MU is embedded in an environment that is inherently dynamic, but information on spatio-temporal dynamics of MU persistence and spread is dramatically lacking. The results shown here represent a step forward in the understanding of MU ecology. They provide the first account of MU spatio-temporal dynamics in aquatic communities from a variety of ecosystems within BU endemic regions. We show first that MU is ubiquitous within these regions and can be found in all types of freshwater ecosystems, but swampy areas seem more favorable to MU presence, as demonstrated in Bankim. Then, we confirm that MU is present in nearly all taxonomic groups of the aquatic community, but we show that groups common in streams are minimally colonized. Finally, we demonstrate that MU has distinctive temporal dynamics in each ecosystem and taxonomic group, suggesting that MU occurrence is probably driven by complex ecological interactions between environmental abiotic and biotic factors. "
432129,1," We found that MU presence in Bankim was more restricted to the south of this area, especially between the Mape´ Dam and the Mbam River, where BU cases concentrate [57] and more swamps and flooded areas prevail. The construction of the dam has been previously associated to the emergence of cases in the area [8,22] and proximity to the Mbam River was found to be a risk factor in a case-control study [22]. However, our results suggest that swamps created along the road, rather than the flooded areas created artificially by the dam or naturally near the Mbam after heavy rains, are more favorable to the presence of MU. Swamps are characterized by stagnant waters with low oxygen and high temperatures, which may create conditions favorable to MU growth and specific fauna in which to develop [16–19]. Furthermore, while water level and conditions in flooded areas are highly variable throughout the year, swamps are more stable environments, which could influence the differences observed in these two stagnant ecosystems [58]. "
432129,2," In contrast, MU is present everywhere across the Akonolinga region and all environments presented very similar positivity, although the highest positivity concentrated near the basin of the Nyong river. While climate, land cover or human modifications of the environment could be behind these disparate regional distributions, it could also reflect a spread of the bacteria over time. Indeed, it is possible that MU initially persists in the most favorable environments (swamps), as in the case of Bankim where cases have been reported for less than 10 years [8], spreading over time to other environments where water conditions and aquatic communities are less favorable and/or intermittent along the year, as in the case of Akonolinga where MU is endemic for more than 40 years [6]. Flying insects could be responsible of this dissemination as previously suggested [38,59]. Out of the two taxonomic orders that are both aquatic in adult stage and capable of flight (Coleoptera and Hemiptera), only Hemiptera was found positive in all types of ecosystem. Indeed, this group was found positive to MU in 65% of the sites, more than any other group of the aquatic community (table S4). "
432129,3," MU is present in nearly every group of the aquatic community and no taxonomic group stands among others as the major host carrier of MU. Aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as semi-aquatic groups, are positive for IS2404 and KR, with similar pool prevalence. This is in line with the idea of multi-host transmission dynamics and more particularly a transmission through ecological webs, where some species can highly contribute to MU transmission without experiencing a significantly larger positivity [32]. Nevertheless, some patterns arise for several specific taxonomic groups. Firstly, the most positive order in terms of pool prevalence are Lepidoptera larvae (caterpillars), an invertebrate with semi-aquatic families mostly living and feeding on riverine aquatic plants [42]. This finding suggests that some aquatic plants might play an important role on MU persistence and development in the aquatic ecosystem or in ecotone areas, and be a source of infection for herbivorous invertebrates. Indeed, some plants could harbor MU in endemic regions [24,60] and they stimulate its growth under experimental conditions [61]. Secondly, groups of aquatic invertebrates that were found mainly in streams such as Trichoptera and Decapoda are among the groups with the lowest pool prevalence. These findings support the hypothesis that MU might not be well adapted to environmental conditions in this type of aquatic ecosystems. "
432129,4," Regarding the seasonal dynamics, MU is present in freshwater ecosystems and aquatic organisms throughout the year but there are fluctuations both between seasons and within each season, as previously demonstrated for MU colonization of water bugs [38]. The highest peak in positivity appears in August and October (i.e. over the high rainy season), and then decreases progressively throughout the high dry season (November to February). These findings could be consistent with the idea of a run-off of bacteria into the aquatic environment during periods of intensive rainfall, as previously suggested [24,62]. However, the lack of correlation between rainfall patterns and the dynamics observed for the various ecosystems and taxonomic orders highlights that more complex interactions might take place within the aquatic community. Differences in feeding habits may explain the distinct colonization dynamics of different orders. For instance, while Hemiptera were found positive all year long (except in May), Coleoptera were repeatedly found negative for more than half a year (Figure 5). These two orders share many common features: they have both larval and adult aquatic stages, many are capable of flight, and their abundance dynamics along the year are very similar (Figure S3 and S4). However, while most families of Hemiptera are voracious predators of aquatic organisms (only Corixidae feed on aquatic plants), families of Coleoptera present a large spectrum of feeding habits that include predators, shredders, scrappers, filtering collectors and omnivorous organisms [41,42]. Laboratory experiments support the idea of a trophic transmission of MU through predation [30,34,63,64] and a mathematical model studying MU prevalence within 27 aquatic communities in Ghana suggested that a transmission through ecological webs is more likely than a purely environmental acquisition from contaminated water [32]. Our results support the hypothesis that biotic interactions may play a role in MU transmission and that MU dynamics could result from a complex interplay between environmental abiotic factors and variations in community assemblages. "
432129,5," We show that important fluctuations in MU positivity take place within each particular ecosystem. For most sites, we checked for the presence of MU in a given month and site by analysing 6 pools of aquatic organisms. This may be insufficient to demonstrate the absence of the bacteria in the ecosystem, since pool positivity overall was lower than 10%. We attempted to increase the chances to detect MU by pooling all individuals of the most abundant taxonomic orders in the aquatic ecosystem, which allowed us to pool and analyze over 60% of the 238,496 individuals sampled without losing comparability of the results. Furthermore, disparate sampling strategies for each region could be behind the differences found between the types of environment for the two study regions. Bankim was only sampled 4 months of the year as opposed to 12 months in Akonolinga. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that sampling in Bankim may have taken place at appropriate times of the year for swamps but not for the other environments in this region. We tried to avoid this by sampling in Bankim at regular intervals (every three months), therefore capturing a maximum of variability along the year. "
432129,6," This study reinforces the idea that MU persists in a wide range of locations [24,40] and taxonomic groups [28] and the pool positivity rates described here (nearly 10% overall) are consistent with previous studies [8,28,38]. This ubiquity of MU and its persistence in the environment throughout the year contrast with the focal distribution and low number of BU human cases in endemic regions. A possible explanation is that while we are likely to be detecting one (or several) of the MU ecovars present in the M. ulcerans Dynamics in Freshwater Ecosystems and Aquatic Communities environment (previously referred to as mycolactone producing mycobacteria), this does not necessarily imply that we are detecting strains of MU with pathogenic potential to cause BU in humans [17,65–67]. Future studies comparing the strain diversity of environmental and human samples with molecular techniques such as SNP typing [68,69] could shed some light on this issue. Furthermore, we rely as previous studies on qPCR amplification of KR and IS2404 sequences as an indicator of the presence of MU, which gives no certainty of whether the DNA detected belongs to viable mycobacteria. The lack of an appropriate technique to culture MU from the environment remains a major limitation of fieldwork studies. Nevertheless, qPCR remains the gold standard for environmental studies on MU ecology [8,27,38,40]. An alternative hypothesis is that while the presence of MU in the environment reflects a potential risk for infection, many environmental and socio-economic factors may need to come together to enable MU transmission to humans. Sero-epidemiological studies have shown that a large proportion of the population living in endemic regions have been exposed to MU, but only a small fraction develop the disease [70]. Therefore, MU might only trigger BU disease under certain environmental conditions (a bacterial concentration threshold and/or contact with a competent, infected vector) or in subpopulations in high contact with potential sources of infection and with increased susceptibility to infection (due to immunity, hygiene, etc.). "
432129,7," In conclusion, this study provides for the first time a detailed characterization through space and time of MU presence in two BU endemic regions with distinct environmental conditions. The understanding of MU ecology to date is still limited, especially regarding the conditions that allow this mycobacterium to persist in the environment and be transmitted to humans. Our study attempts to complete previous approaches by sampling multiple aquatic communities over time in order to better understand the influence of aquatic ecosystems on MU presence and its dynamics along the year. The global trend we describe for MU dynamics could be the result of complex ecological processes, with interactions between environmental abiotic and biotic factors that require deeper analysis, something that is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we believe that coupling data produced by such field studies with fine-scale epidemiological data and integrated through statistical and mathematical models could provide a major step forward in the understanding of MU ecology and BU mode of transmission."
432234,0," In this paper we present results from a large scale study of M. ulcerans in the environment. Although a number of studies have reported the presence of M. ulcerans in environmental samples from endemic regions [13,16,17,33], study where standardized ecological methods were used to reduce sampling bias, and the first to include longitudinal data from both Buruli ulcer endemic and non-endemic sties. One of the mysteries of Buruli ulcer is the close proximity of endemic and non-endemic villages. For example, whereas the disease is rarely reported from the Ga East district of the Greater Accra region in Ghana, it is endemic in the Ga West district despite the fact that endemic and non-endemic villages may be separated by only a few kilometers (Figure 3). Since the climate, rainfall, plant populations and ethnic groups in Ga East and Ga West are similar it has been difficult to understand the differential occurrence of Buruli ulcer within these regions. "
432234,1," The most important finding from this study is that, whereas Buruli ulcer occurs within discrete geographic village foci within endemic regions, M. ulcerans is widely distributed in water bodies in both endemic and non-endemic villages in the Greater Accra and Ashanti regions. This is consistent with its position as an environmental pathogen. We have also been able to repeatedly detect the presence of M. ulcerans within some sites over a 27 month framework suggesting the long term survival and presence of M. ulcerans in specific locations. These results clearly show that the focal occurrence of Buruli ulcer within the Greater Accra and Ashanti regions cannot be explained by the presence or absence of M. ulcerans in the environment. Thus other factors such as demography and human behavior may be important in the epidemiology of Buruli ulcer in these regions. "
432234,2," In contrast, there are large geographic areas in West Africa such as the Volta region of Ghana, or drier Northern parts of Ghana, Benin and Togo, where Buruli ulcer has never been reported. It has been assumed that the absence of Buruli ulcer from these regions is based on environmental constraints which restrict the growth of M. ulcerans or potential reservoir species. Results from an on-going project in the Volta region confirm this hypothesis in that we have failed to reveal a single M. ulcerans positive sample out of hundreds of invertebrate, water filtrate or macrophyte samples from 20 sites sampled. The absence of Buruli ulcer in Volta is explained by the absence of M. ulcerans (work in progress). "
432234,3," In a clinical setting the use of a single PCR target for detection of a pathogen is widely accepted. However, the use of a single PCR target for identification of bacteria in an environmental sample is rarely adequate. In Ghana, analysis of many IS2404 positive samples revealed the presence of mycolactone producing mycobacterial species (MPMs) other than M. ulcerans as had been predicted [29]. In contrast, in Australia IS2404 PCR appears to be specific for M. ulcerans because of the absence of other MPMs [33]. Here we provide the first evidence for the presence of MPMs in West Africa and show that MPMs and M. ulcerans share aquatic environments. The pathogenic potential of MPM for humans is unknown, although the lower growth temperature of some of these species makes them unlikely human pathogens [26]. The fact that the strain complexity of MPMs and M. ulcerans is greater in endemic areas and greatest within the Greater Accra region is an intriguing finding which needs further investigation. "
432234,4," The use of geographic-specific VNTR profiles in following chains of transmission is extremely important since the heteroge- neity of M. ulcerans isolates appears to differ within different West African countries [23,24,25]. For example, data based primarily on patient isolates from Benin led to the conclusion that there was a single West African M. ulcerans clone. However, several biovars have been identified in Ghana [23]. Our results agree with those of Hilty et al [23] in showing the presence of that at least 3 different VNTR profiles in Ghana. Thus it is important when discriminat- ing between M. ulcerans and other MPM that a geographically representative set of patient isolates is used. "
432234,5," Our initial concerns regarding the effect of low target copy number on the sensitivity of PCR methods reflected our naivete´ regarding PCR theory. We had not considered that the efficiency M. ulcerans in Aquatic Environments in Ghana of the PCR reaction depends on many factors including the efficiency of primer binding, the length of the product and local DNA conformation or that because the reaction is exponential, the first few targets bound may rapidly become the major products. Experimental results confirm this theory since others have found no difference between the use of IS2404 PCR and that of 16sRNA PCR for detection of M. ulcerans in human samples despite the enormous difference in copy number [34] and results from VNTR analysis of clinical isolates show gel bands with an intensity never reported for IS2404 PCR [23] . It is possible that the fact that VNTR sequences are non-coding segments of DNA may make them more accessible to primer binding. "
432234,6," Our studies confirm the presence of M. ulcerans in predacious aquatic insects including Belostomatidae and Naucoridae families reported by Portaels et al [15] and extend these findings by showing that VNTR profiles from these insects match those of human isolates of M. ulcerans. Belostomatids were common in many sites sampled throughout the year. However, even where large numbers of Belostomatidae were collected the rate of M. ulcerans infection was very low. In Ghana, despite repeated seasonal sampling the numbers of naucorids found were very low (paper in preparation). Evidence for the role of naucorids as potential M. ulcerans vectors comes from studies in Cote d’Ivoire [16]. Insect population studies are needed to confirm whether naucorids are more abundant in Cote d’Ivoire than in Ghana. "
432234,7," Our results show that M. ulcerans is widely distributed within invertebrate communities in aquatic environments. However, the M. ulcerans-positive, predacious invertebrates are none of hematophagous; thus the frequency with which humans are bitten would be expected to be quite low [35]. Although potential trophic relationships exist between several taxa studied (belostomatids, for example, feed on many other invertebrates and vertebrates and also cannibalize each other), it will take considerably more work to elucidate chains of transmission within the environment. Results presented here are based on determining the presence or absence of M. ulcerans in an environmental sample. Further studies need to be conducted using quantitative PCR methods to determine which species are most heavily infected and thus are more likely to serve as vectors. "
432234,8," Although it has been reported that snails and fish may harbor M. ulcerans [17] our results suggest the possibility that many of the IS2404 positive mycobacteria detected are MPM other than M. ulcerans. In our studies M. ulcerans was never detected in fish or snails, although other MPM were identified in later studies. The most consistently M. ulcerans-positive samples detected were filtered water and biofilms on glass slides. This suggests that exposure of open lesions to infected water cannot be ruled out as a potential source of infection. "
432234,9," A general problem regarding detection of M. ulcerans in environmental samples is that evidence has come almost solely from detection of M. ulcerans DNA and under-estimation of M. ulcerans could result due to the presence of PCR inhibitors. Our results suggest that current methods are effective in eliminating PCR inhibitors since dilution of samples did not result in the detection of many additional ER positive samples and none of those detected through dilution could be confirmed by sequencing. Despite the broad spectrum of samples we did not find evidence for inhibitors in any particular taxa or sample type tested. Nonetheless, the possibility exists that the number of positive M. ulcerans positive samples may be underestimated. "
432234,10," The use of slide biofilms for trapping mycobacteria in the environment has proven particularly useful since it provides preliminary physical evidence for the presence of mycobacteria (AFB staining) along with molecular evidence, and facilitates longitudinal studies. The numbers of slides used and placement of PVC pipes are crucial because of the inevitable loss of slides through changes in water level, or disturbance by animals or humans. There was a decrease of DNA samples from slides giving a VNTR profile matching M. ulcerans between 42 and 98 days in the two water bodies (Figure 5). There was, however, an increase in DNA samples from slides producing a VNTR profile matching other MPM s. These data suggest bacterial community dynamics between M. ulcerans and other MPMs. "
432234,11," In summary, we have developed new methods for mapping the distribution of M. ulcerans in aquatic environments and applied these in the Greater Accra and Ashanti regions of Ghana. This work is part of a much larger five year project in which data from water chemistry, LandSat satellite imaging of land cover, and macrophyte and aquatic invertebrate population structure will be used to define the broad ecology of M. ulcerans. The presence of M. ulcerans in both endemic and non-endemic villages within endemic regions suggests that studies of human ecology will be necessary to unravel the mysteries surrounding the transmission of M. ulcerans to in this work is to define the M. ulcerans humans. Our goal environment in order to develop programs for preventing human exposure. The findings presented here show the possibility of tracing transmission of M. ulcerans from the environment to humans. This work represents a small step towards solving the mysteries surrounding human infection."
434379,0," The current diagnostic delay experienced by Buruli ulcer patients contributes to morbidity and increased economic hardship [37]. A diagnostic test that is rapid, inexpensive, sensitive, specific and suitable for in-field use would facilitate the timely diagnosis of BU and is a World Health Organization (WHO) research priority. Current laboratory diagnostics including culture, PCR, AFB microscopy and histopathology all have various limitations. We have used comparative genomics to identify M. ulcerans specific sequences to explore the usefulness of the encoded proteins for use in the serodiagnosis of Buruli Ulcer in endemic areas of West Africa. "
434379,1," Whilst bioinformatic methods were initially used to identify M. ulcerans specific CDS, eleven of these ‘‘M. ulcerans specific’’ CDS were found in at least one of the M. marinum strains tested (Table 1). These CDS are distributed across the M. ulcerans genome, and were all situated within regions of DNA that are not present in the M. marinum M genome. It is interesting to note that some of these sequences appear restricted to certain M. marinum sequence types that are genetically closer to M. ulcerans than the sequenced M. marinum M strain. For example MUL_4213 was restricted to the ST3 and ST5 strains tested and MUL_0027 was restricted to the ST3 strains tested. Some of these sequences may be useful as genotyping tools to more clearly delineate the relationships between M. ulcerans and M. marinum strains. These findings are consistent with the known high genetic relatedness of M. ulcerans and M. marinum [10,13], and underlies the need for experimental validation of bioinformatic results. "
434379,2," Only nine M. ulcerans specific sequences were conserved amongst all mycolactone producing mycobacterial strains tested. However, in agreement with previous findings that African M. ulcerans strains form a close genetic complex with relatively little variation at the whole genome level [38,39,40], all selected chromosomal genes were present in all African M. ulcerans isolates that were examined. As pMUM plasmids are known to vary in size and gene content between M. ulcerans strains [11,33], it is not surprising that only six of 33 non-PKS CDS were completely conserved. However, plasmid CDS may be the most specific to M. ulcerans as they appear to be restricted to mycolactone producing mycobacteria. "
434379,3," During the course of this work the sequences of two other pMUM plasmids from MPM became available [11] and revealed a number of differences between these plasmids with regards to the potential antigens chosen for this study. These differences can explain the inability to detect some of the selected CDS in MPM strains. For example, MUP006 orthologs in pMUM002 and pMUM003 contain a different 59 nucleotide sequence, explaining the absence of a PCR product in some MPM strains. Conversely, MUP068 and MUP070 orthologs in pMUM001 and pMUM002 contain different 39 nucleotide sequences. Furthermore, MUP065 appears to be a pseudogene in pMUM001, as its ortholog in pMUM002 and pMUM003 are significantly longer, and MUP067 is deleted from pMUM002 and pMUM003. All of these examples serve to highlight the genetic variability in the non-PKS component of these pMUM plasmids. "
434379,4," In this study 44 M. ulcerans specific sequences were cloned with 37 (84%) of these successfully expressed in E. coli. Seven proteins were unable to be expressed in multiple E. coli strains, and the lack of overexpressed protein was confirmed by western blotting (data not shown). Similar studies that have attempted to identify novel CDS in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis have also shown variable rates of production of 6 x His tagged proteins (between 25 – 69% of cloned CDS able to be expressed) [41,42], indicating that this tag may reduce expression of certain proteins. Furthermore, all proteins in this study were found to be insoluble under the expression conditions used, and six of the seven proteins that were unable to be expressed were predicted to be integral membrane proteins, with overexpression of these proteins possibly leading to toxicity. Both of these problems have been previously described in other mycobacterial protein expression studies [43,44,45]. Clearly, further optimization of the expression of these proteins, including the use of alternate proteins tags or different host-based expression systems (including mycobacteria) may be necessary to obtain useable amounts of protein for future testing. Recently, a Gateway-based vector has been developed for the overexpression of proteins in M. smegmatis and has shown that proteins which were previously insoluble in E. coli could be expressed in soluble form in M. smegmatis [46]. Furthermore, M. tuberculosis proteins have been successfully produced in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris with enhanced patient serum reactivity compared with those produced in E. coli [47,48]. The future use of either of these systems for the proteins that proved difficult to produce in this study may be warranted to investigate their antigenicity. "
434379,5," We were able to confirm that patients with BU had significantly greater IgG antibody responses to seven of 33 purified M. ulcerans proteins as determined by ELISA compared with a control group (Figure 1). The inability of the remaining 26 proteins to discriminate between patients and controls is likely due to either the inability of a particular protein to elicit an antibody response or through shared epitopes with proteins from other sources leading to cross-reactive antibody responses. However, none of the proteins were able to discriminate between patients and control subjects from the same BU-endemic area and are therefore unlikely to be useful as a diagnostic test for M. ulcerans infection. By combining measurements of antibody responses to six antigens from people living in a BU endemic area, we were able to discriminate between subjects resident in endemic areas of Benin and controls living in a non-endemic area. Although it remains a possibility that these data reflect cross-reactive antibody responses to other mycobacteria, we suggest that the most likely interpre- tation of these findings is that many residents of BU-endemic areas have been exposed to M. ulcerans. "
434379,6," Somewhat surprisingly, the most discriminatory antigen was Hsp65, which has 94% homology to the same protein from M. tuberculosis, whilst antigens with no orthologues in other mycobac- teria had lower sensitivity and specificity. Hsp65 is known to be an immunodominant antigen in the antibody response to mycobac- teria [35] and we anticipated that all groups would have had significant levels of exposure to other mycobacteria from either BCG vaccination, tuberculosis infection, and from exposure to other environmental mycobacteria. We therefore anticipated that Hsp65 would be a sensitive but non-specific antigen. There may be several explanations for our findings. Firstly, patients and endemic controls were both from a region of high BU prevalence and therefore may have been recently and/or frequently exposed to M. ulcerans, leading to continual boosting of antibody responses that does not occur in the non-endemic control group. The fact that M. ulcerans elicits responses dominated by antibodies to Hsp65 at all stages of the infection in mice supports this hypothesis (35). Alternatively, it is possible that our patient and control groups differed in their exposure to mycobacteria other than M. ulcerans, and therefore the results do not reflect M. ulcerans specific antibody responses. "
434379,7," The small heat shock protein, Hsp18, had previously been identified as an immunodominant antigen that may be useful for predicting exposure to M. ulcerans [34]. Results from the current study, however, showed that Hsp18 was not able to discriminate between individuals living in an endemic area and those who reside in a non-endemic area. The reasons for these differences are unclear, however, a possible explanation may be that here, antibody responses were quantified by ELISA, as opposed to qualitative western blot analysis in the study by Diaz et al [34]. "
434379,8," Although the other antigens we identified as M. ulcerans specific by our comparative genomic approach did not appear to be as sensitive or specific as Hsp65 in predicting individuals living in a Buruli endemic area, they nevertheless did show that significant antibody responses were detectable, and three antigens (MUL_0513, AT-propionate, KR-B) showed significant ability to discriminate individuals living in a BU endemic versus non- endemic area. Their use in combination may show additive effects and, in conjunction with case-control studies, may permit the development of an assay for detecting individuals exposed to M. ulcerans. More research in this direction would greatly assist efforts to uncover environmental reservoirs and understand transmission pathways of the bacterium. "
434379,9," Although a number of M. ulcerans specific sequences were investigated in this study, there were still a large number that were initially ruled out based on predictions of their cellular location or function. It is possible that some of these potential antigens may be good candidates for further analysis. Based on our findings of high response rates among patient and endemic control groups it appears unlikely that serological approaches will be useful for diagnosing Buruli ulcer. Indeed, the development of serodiagnos- tics for other mycobacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, has proved difficult and many of the currently available serodiagnos- tics for mycobacteria have limited usefulness in the clinic [49,50]. "
434379,10," An alternative to BU serodiagnosis may be possible via direct antigen detection approaches. The extent and distribution of antigens within M. ulcerans lesions or within a patients circulation has not been defined, however, there is the possibility that some of the unique proteins described in this present study may be able to be developed as the basis for antigen capture assays. A diagnostic test based on this methodology would overcome the problems of cross-reactivity seen with tests based upon antibody responses, and would be more appropriate for resource limited areas than tests based on T-cell responses. This project has helped define the antigenic repertoire of M. ulcerans and research is continuing in this vein to investigate the feasibility of other diagnostic modalities."
2491053,0," Invasive monitoring of pulsatile ICP has previously proven to be a precise tool to select which iNPH patients who will respond to surgical shunting. In this study, we tested the utility of PC-MRI to non-invasively assess a surrogate marker for pulsatile ICP, MRI-dP, obtained at level C2. MRI-dP did not correlate with invasively obtained pulsatile ICP from over-night monitoring, and did not discriminate iNPH patients from healthy subjects. "
2491053,1," Increased pulsatile ICP due to reduced intracranial compliance is common in iNPH [7], and patients with this disease should therefore be well suited for a study of non-invasive assess- ment of pulsatile ICP using PC-MRI. In the present study cohort, increased pulsatile ICP expressed by MWA above threshold level was diagnosed in 17 of 22 patients. Surgical shunting yielded a clinical improvement in 16 of 17 treated patients, indicating a high proportion of what may be considered “true iNPH”. "
2491053,2," MRI-dP has previously been applied in a proposed method for non-invasive estimates of static (mean) ICP [14]. With this method, the elastance index is estimated by dividing MRI-dP by the per cardiac cycle total intracranial volumetric change (MRI-dV), i.e. MRI-dP/MRI-dV. The linear relationship between elastance and ICP is expected owing to the monoexponential relationship between intracranial volume and pressure[22]. Precise assessment of MRI-dP is thus an important precondition for such estimation of static ICP as well. "
2491053,3," Should a non-invasive measure such as MRI-dP be valid, it would have to reflect its gold stan- dard of invasive measurement (pulsatile ICP). Both pulsatile and static (mean) ICP demonstrated in this study large fluctuations during the overnight monitoring, and this phenomenon is also a determining factor as to why clinical decisions based on monitoring of pulsatile ICP are made after analysis of observations from an extended time span (Fig 4). A PC-MRI based method applied to obtain measures of pulsatile ICP through a surrogate parameter like MRI-dP from a short time interval should therefore be interpreted with great care. One previous study could not demonstrate different MRI-dP between Chiari malformation type 1 patients and controls[23], even though elevated pulsatile ICP is frequently observed when measured over-night[24].The aqueductal stroke volume is another, MRI derived, CSF velocity based parameter obtained from a short time interval, which has been proposed to serve as a surrogate for ICP recordings[8], and were also unable to demonstrate any association with its invasive counterpart[13, 25]. "
2491053,4," There may be several reasons as to why MRI-dP derived from one simple PC-MRI acquisi- tion does not reflect pulsatile ICP measured overnight. First, MRI-dP is based on acquisition of CSF velocity change at the upper cervical spinal canal, and is thus a surrogate marker for intracranial pressure change. A simplified model of a rigid, cylindrically shaped tube is desir- able in order to make valid assumptions in fluid dynamic equations used in post-processing of PC-MRI data, where attempts made intracranially, with much more complex anatomy, are mostly restricted to the Sylvian aqueduct. However, even though the upper spinal canal is anatomically in close proximity with the intracranial compartment, the geometry is funda- mentally different, and from computational fluid flow dynamics, it has been demonstrated that lower pressure values can be expected at level C2 than in the posterior fossa due to pres- sure gradients that become steep in the cervical canal[26]. "
2491053,5," Secondly, the CSF flow at level C2 is the result of a dyssynchronous pressure pulsation caus- ing a pulsating cranio-cervical pressure gradient pumping CSF in and out of the cranial vault. The pressure gradient estimated from MRI is relatively small, and in this study, less than 0.1 mm Hg per cm in all patients. This magnitude corresponds well with previous studies. From numerical studies, where the CSF flow has been modeled in rigid and impermeable surround- ings, the fluid flow has been predominated by velocities orthogonal to the axial plane, and the observed pressure gradients at level C2 in healthy subjects is also less than 0.1 mm Hg per cm [27, 28]. Computations that take into account the elasticity of the cervical spinal cord, tonsillar motion and the presence of nerve roots and denticulate ligaments, all predict pressure gradi- ents of similar magnitudes[29–31]. Hence, the pressure gradient between the cervical and cra- nial compartments is but a fraction of the total pressure pulsation. "
2491053,6," Moreover, the pressure gradient computation in this study is based on a number of simpli- fying assumptions such as rigid and impermeable surroundings and laminar flow. CSF flow patterns are, however, complex due to the anatomy of the cervical subarachnoid space[26], and flow velocities in axial sections of the spine have been shown to have non-uniform distri- butions throughout the cardiac cycle as demonstrated from computational simulations[28]. In our study, the pixel-by-pixel analysis revealed a wide dispersion of flow velocities from within the same PC-MRI slab (Fig 8). Averaging of flow velocities from a ROI defining the CSF space therefore does not fully describe the diversity or complexity of velocity changes that occurs through a section of the cervical spine during one cardiac cycle. "
2491053,7," Interestingly, it may be noted that the healthy control with smallest CSF ROI area also had the largest MRI-dP among controls (No. 2 in S3 Table), and larger than in many iNPH patients with invasively proven increased pulsatile ICP (S2 Table). Previously, the inverse and almost linear rela- tionship between MRI-dP and CSF flow area has been reported[14], and very steep pressure gra- dients have also been demonstrated in Chiari patients with tonsillar crowding at the foramen magnum[32]. For the patient group in our study, there was a trend towards an inverse correlation between MRI-dP and area of the subarachnoid fluid area at level C2 (ROI area), but this did not reach significant levels (R = -.32, P = .15). However, we notice that measuring reliability (ICC) was almost identical for MRI-dP and ROI area measurements in healthy controls. Thus, while MRI-dP should ideally be a marker of pulsatile ICP only, it may be hypothesized that a narrow CSF space surrounding the spinal cord may influence directly on MRI-dP. However, CSF area is already implicitly accounted for when estimating pressure based on the Navier-Stokes equation. "
2491053,8," Finally, but not least, recent studies have demonstrated respiration to have a major influ- ence on CSF flow [33, 34]. With cardiac gated PC-MRI, which can be considered to represent current state-of-the-art methodology in PC-MRI based measurements of intracranial and intraspinal CSF flow quantification, only cardiac beat induced CSF flow is detected. Patient breathing is not controlled for. "
2491053,9," The invasive ICP measurements of this study were not performed synchronously with PC-MRI, but overnight, as standardized according to previous empirical observations support- ing this routine. In principle, our data do therefore not in principle contradict that MRI-dP may reflect pulsatile ICP in real time. The comparison with invasive monitoring for a pro- longed time period is, however, highly relevant, because clinical decision making is rarely based on ICP monitoring from a time interval as short as the duration of a PC-MRI acquisi- tion. It has previously also been validated that over-night and daytime measurements of pulsa- tile ICP are comparable, unlike measurements of static ICP[2]. "
2491053,10," Another limitation was that technically adequate PC-MRI was obtained in less than 2/3 of enrolled patients, while all examinations in healthy subjects were successful. NPH patients are typically elderly and suffer from discomfort during long MRI scan times, and the experimental PC-MRI acquisitions were performed towards the end of the imaging protocol. In iNPH, dementia is a common feature, which may be a challenge to patient cooperation throughout the scan. MRI-dP from PC-MRI may therefore seem more feasible in subjects that cooperate well rather than in patients where compliance to instructions from the MR technician can be a challenge. The inability to exam patients with the poorest level of cooperation skills may have introduced bias to the study, because more severely affected patients might have been more likely to be excluded. "
2491053,11," Moreover, the velocity encoding gradient (venc) was set at a low level for the PC-MRI acquisitions in patients and healthy controls. Because of flow heterogeneities, flow aliasing was quite frequent. We consider, however, this potential source of error to be small because of the aliasing correction procedure and that flow velocity values from each time point represent the average of velocities from the entire region of interest. Pixels with any inaccuracies of flow velocity measurements should therefore not have contributed substantially to the calculated MRI-dP. "
2491053,12," As for PC-MRI based measurements of CSF flow in general, a major concern with the tech- nique would be the extraction of data from a limited time interval to make a diagnosis in patients where well-known physiological fluctuations are present. In the present study, all PC-MRI exams may be assumed to have been performed within normal physiological bound- aries, as they were obtained within a normal range for heart rate (Tables 2 and 3), and the sta- tistical analysis did not reveal any systematic differences in heart rate (HR) between PC-MRI and ICP monitoring. This indicates that influence from patient stress and discomfort was not very different during PC-MRI and ICP monitoring, and this source of bias in comparing the methods should therefore have been modest."
1442658,0," Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by demyelination centered around the cerebral veins in the white matter (1, 2). CCSVI has been suggested as a new hypothesis for the etiopathogenesis of MS disease in terms of this topographic relationship. CCSVI-related MS hypothesis suggests that significant decrease in CSF flow occurs through cerebral aqueducts secondary to impaired venous outflow from the CNS (8, 17, 18). The normal CSF circulation depends on the proper balance between CSF ultrafiltration (from lateral ventricular veins) and venous system clearance from CSF opening at the level of dural sinuses (19, 20, 21). "
1442658,1," Zamboni et al. (17) have described abnormal venous hemodynamics by identifying multiple extracranial venous structures of unknown origin using extracranial-transcranial color Doppler and selective venography. CCSVI-related MS hypothesis claims that venous reflux leads to iron deposition in the CNS, triggering autoimmune process with disruption of the blood-brain barrier (8). PC-MRI facilitates accurate and noninvasive evaluation of the flow direction and flow rate of intracranial blood and CSF (12, 13, 14, 22, 23). "
1442658,2," Zamboni et al. (10) reported a strong relationship between CCSVI and MS. However, Zamboni et al. (9, 11) found a significantly higher prevalence of CCSVI in MS patients, as compared to controls; and consequently, a decrease in net CSF flow (mL/beat) passing through the cerebral aqueduct. They concluded that CCSVI has a marked effect especially on intracranial fluid balance in the pathophysiology of brain. "
1442658,3," In their study, Zamboni et al. (10) addressed the questions of whether CCSVI affects the clinical process of MS and whether venous stenosis is a cause or a result of MS. Baracchini et al. (24) and Simka et al. (25) reported a cause and effect relationship between MS and CCSVI; while Patti et al. (26) reported no relationship between MS and CCSVI. However, CSF flow dynamics were not mentioned in these studies. "
1442658,4," Sundström et al. (27) performed a study to test the hypothesis of CCSVI and, unlike Zamboni et al. (11), did not detect any difference in internal jugular venous outflow and aqueductal CSF flow between RRMS patients and the control group. Gorucu et al. (28) reported that the net CSF flow volume showed no significant differences between MS patients and controls. In the present study, the net CSF flow volume (mL/beat) and average flow (mL/sec) parameters evaluated with PC-MRI, were not found to be statistically significant between MS patients and the control group. Additionally, MS patients were divided into 2 groups according to the condition of plaques that were detected on MRI: MS patients with active plaques who exhibit contrast enhancement and those with chronic disease non-enhancement. To our best knowledge, PC-MRI study for CSF dynamics in the active phase of the disease has not been reported. If CSF flow is decreased due to impaired extracranial venous drainage in MS patients, based on the study of Zamboni et al. (11), we expected lower CSF flow values in the intense period of active inflammation. Therefore, we determined whether PC-MRI contributes to differential diagnosis of active and chronic disease in MS. Craniocaudal (forward) and caudocranial (reverse) CSF flow volumes (mL/beat) and aqueductal area were higher in the MS patients with chronic plaques, as compared to patients with active plaques; and of these parameters, reverse volume was statistically significant. In addition, these parameters were higher in MS patients, as compared with the control group. "
1442658,5," Our study compared flow speeds in addition to CSF flow volumes passing from the cerebral aqueduct in MS patients. No significant difference was found in terms of average velocity. However, peak velocity value was found to be significantly higher in MS patients with chronic plaque, as compared with the control group. "
1442658,6," Increased craniocaudal and caudocranial CSF flow volume and aqueductal area in MS patients could possibly be due to cerebral atrophic changes that may occur at every stage of MS. CSF spaces expand with cerebral atrophy and consequently, CSF flow volumes in a cardiac cycle pass through the cerebral aqueduct. In MS patients, peak velocity increase can depend on the volume increases in the CSF circulation. Thus, in MS patients with these findings, absence of a significant change in the net CSF flow volume and average velocity, supports this concept. Likewise, Chiang et al. (29) concluded that the aqueductal CSF flow should not be considered independently of ventricular morphology. Zamboni et al. (9) suggested that impaired CSF dynamics in MS patients contributes to an increase in volumes of the third and lateral ventricles. In addition, reverse volume in the definitive diagnosis of active and chronic period MS disease, was higher in MS patients with chronic plaques. This result can be used in the place of contrast-enhanced MRI. "
1442658,7," We did not evaluate the venous outflow abnormalities and the ventricle volumes, which is a limitation of our study. In addition, PC-MRI may result in errors in quantitative measurements, due to non-linear gradients, partial volume effects, and errors in placing ROI (12, 30, 31). In cases with narrow aqueducts, difficulties in placing ROI can increase the error rate (32). For a reliable measurement, the area of aqueducts should be over 1.5 mm2 (14). In our study, the case with the smallest aqueducts area was in the control group with 1.6 mm2. "
1442658,8," In conclusion, in the present study, the peak velocity, caudocranial and craniocaudal CSF flow volumes, and aqueductal area were significantly higher in the MS patients. Within the framework of the CCSVI hypothesis, the results of our study did not support the hypothesis that CSF flow decreases in MS patients. Nevertheless, CSF flow, was altered in MS patients. The increase in CSF flow in our study could be due to atrophy-dependent ventricular system dilation and subsequent decrease in the overall cerebral aqueduct resistance. In turn, the altered cerebral flow physiology may be used to differentiate active versus chronic disease. Larger controlled studies are needed to determine the entire scope of CSF dynamics and extracranial venous hemodynamics within the framework of the CCSVI hypothesis on MS etiology and pathogenesis."
433520,0," The aim of this study was to assess the role of water bugs as hosts and vectors of M. ulcerans, in the complete environmental context. To this end, we carried out an extensive field study on unprecedented temporal and spatial scales, monitoring the distribution of water bugs harboring M. ulcerans and the dissemination of M. ulcerans in the environment. We assessed water bug diversity and determined the frequency of insect tissue colonization by M. ulcerans in the various seasons, in an area in which Buruli ulcer is endemic (Akonolinga, Cameroon). For the purposes of comparison, the study also covered an area in which Buruli ulcer is not endemic. In short, the specificities of the study are: (i) focusing entirely on water bugs; (ii) the collection of samples from the same water body in all four seasons and (iii) large-scale sample collection in Buruli ulcer endemic and non endemic areas, with subsequent analysis of the captured water bug specimens (7407 specimens collected, 696 pools analyzed). "
433520,1," We document here, for the first time, fluctuations in the density of water bug families in an area in which Buruli ulcer is endemic, over the course of a year. The highest density of water bugs is recorded in January, during the long dry season. Variations of water bug density described here are in agreement with those in another study in a tropical area (Costa Rica) [45]. The causes of these fluctuations remain unclear, but several possible factors have been identified, including abrupt changes in environmental conditions or prey density [33,45–46]. Seven water bug families were identified in Buruli ulcer endemic and non endemic areas, including many unknown species. This latter point is not surprising, as determination keys for water bug species are not yet available for West Africa. One key finding of our study was the striking difference between the endemic and non endemic areas in terms of the density of water bugs, with the density in the endemic area more than 10 times higher that in the non endemic area. It can be noticed that this observation is not in accordance with results in another published study [31]. However, the conclusions of this previous study were drawn based on data for a significantly smaller number of specimens (only 200 water bugs; 2% of the invertebrates collected [31]). "
433520,2," M. ulcerans DNA was detected in five of the seven families of water bugs in the endemic area. The mean rate of colonization was about 10%. However, large fluctuations were observed in the insect colonization by M. ulcerans (1.4 to 33.9%). As rate of observed for other hosts of microorganisms [47–48], there was no correlation between water bug density and rates of water bug colonization by M. ulcerans. We detected no M. ulcerans DNA in insects from the non endemic area, despite the high rates of colonization reported for the nearby endemic area. One key difference between the endemic and non endemic areas concerned human activity. Despite their close physical proximity, the non endemic area was largely unaffected by human activity, whereas, in the endemic area, the bank of the Nyong River had been deforested, for agricultural and fishing activities (Figure 1B and C). Interventions disrupting the environment have been identified, in several studies, as factors potentially favoring the establishment of M. ulcerans in remodeled environments [13– 15,49]. The observed fluctuations in colonization rate may be accounted for by changes in the level of water in the Nyong River, which falls markedly in the dry season. Our results are supported by the findings of an epidemiological study performed in 1993 [50], in which low water levels in the dry season were found to favor the transmission of M. ulcerans to humans. Several factors may be involved in this phenomenon, including greater access to nutrients (resulting in an increase in M. ulcerans density) and the abundance of aquatic vegetation favoring M. ulcerans biofilm formation [26,30,51] (increasing the level of contact between M. ulcerans and water bugs). The water bugs from the family Corixidae were the only phytophagous insects inventoried here. These water bugs were detected only in January, when they were present in high abundance, and displayed the highest rate of colonization by M. ulcerans (43.7%). The high frequency of colonization by M. ulcerans in Corixidae supports the hypothesis that aquatic plants may be the primary reservoir of M. ulcerans, as previously suggested [26]. This specific family may be involved in spreading the bacillus to other trophic levels, as they are eaten by other water bugs, aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates. These observations suggest that M. ulcerans may colonize different levels within the trophic chain (aquatic plants, invertebrates and vertebrates), as already consid- ered [21,30,52–53]. In addition, three water bug families are known to be good flyers [33,45,54–57] and were identified as M. ulcerans hosts in our study. These water bugs may therefore be involved in disseminating M. ulcerans in the environment, as previously proposed by Portaels and Meyers [34]. "
433520,3," We showed that water bug saliva could harbor bacilli. M. ulcerans may therefore be present in the saliva under natural conditions, with the bacilli colonizing the salivary glands of the insect. This could provide a route for M. ulcerans transmission in natural conditions, in accordance with previous experimental demonstrations in laboratory conditions [24,28]. It should be noted that the bacilli present in the saliva of Appasus sp. induced an M. ulcerans-containing lesion following the inoculation of mouse tail. However, it was not possible to isolate these bacilli by conventional culture methods. The lack of appropriate culture media and decontamination procedures adapted to the isolation of M. ulcerans (from the environment) thus remain a major handicap, hindering investigations of the ecology and mode of transmission of this mycobacterium. "
433520,4," The various results presented above provide further evidence that water bugs are hosts and vectors of M. ulcerans, and provide insight into the environmental context underlying transmission. However, no definitive conclusion can yet be drawn concerning the precise importance of this route of transmission. The presence, in human sera, of antibodies binding water bug salivary gland extracts may be accounted for by the exposure of humans to water bug bites [27]. Indeed, reports of the exposure of humans to blood-feeding arthropods, which are known to act as hosts and vectors for parasitic microorganisms, are becoming increasingly frequent [38–39]. To gain a complete picture of the transmission route it would have been desirable to explore the relationship between the incidence of the disease in humans and the rate of colonization of water bugs by M. ulcerans, over a one-year period. Such exploration was however hampered by the amount of accessible information, with several important parameters not available : (i) incubation time between exposure to M. ulcerans and the appearance of the first clinical lesions (currently estimated at between a few weeks and several months); (ii) the slow progression of clinical lesions, resulting in patients being diagnosed at different stages of the disease (rarely at early stages) and (iii) the small number of Buruli ulcer patients diagnosed with early lesions between October 2007 and July 2008 in Akonolinga (84 Buruli ulcer patients, including 15 with early lesions). that suggest In conclusion, this study sheds light on the natural history of M. ulcerans within its ecosystem. The observed fluctuations in insect colonization rates there may be a particularly favorable period for the development of M. ulcerans in natural conditions, and a favorable period for the transmission of M. ulcerans to humans (as previously suggested [50,58] and observed for Plasmodium sp. [47,59–60]). It is also noticeable that the results here can be put to advantage for practical applications, with surveillance and prevention purposes [27,61]. More precisely, our work suggests that the detection of M. ulcerans in water bug saliva could be used as an environmental indicator of the risk of M. ulcerans transmission to humans. It would then be possible to set up environmental surveillance (detection of M. ulcerans DNA in water bug tissue and saliva) in non endemic areas close to Buruli ulcer endemic areas. Health messages concerning environmental risk factors could be specifically targeted at populations newly exposed to the risk of M. ulcerans infection, as is already the case for protective factors (wearing long clothing during farming activities and use of bed nets) [16]."
1691937,0," Buruli ulcer is one of the neglected tropical diseases in the world for which the mode(s) of transmission continues to be unclear, and for which there remains considerable debate in the scientific literature1,13. While experimental studies have shown that transmission through direct inoculation and water bug bites are both possible under lab-oratory conditions18,20,21,23,29, the relative importance of each of these transmission routes to human populations where BU is endemic is not established. Furthermore, the low number of cases in endemic areas hampers the development of cohort studies while the long incubation period and time to seek treatment of the disease obscure the results of case-control studies. This calls for innovative epidemiological study designs. In this study, we com-pare MU spatial and temporal dynamics in aquatic ecosystems and water bugs with the dynamics of BU cases to determine the potential contribution of each of these routes of transmission to observed disease patterns. Our two different, independent, approaches reinforce the conclusion that MU is primarily transmitted directly from the environment. None of the analyses suggest that BU is transmitted primarily by water bugs despite the common prevalence of MU found in these insects18. "
1691937,1," Environmental transmission – non-specific inoculation of MU from contaminated environments to humans–explains almost the entire observed temporal dynamics of BU incidence, whereas the contribution of the water bug transmission in our model is negligible. The fluctuations in environmental MU concentration over time explain the dynamics of BU cases in Akonolinga for the study period. However, the predictions from the best temporal fit seemed to reveal higher frequency variations in the number of cases over time than what was observed in the region (Fig. 2A). These differences are likely to be due to either seasonal changes in human exposure that are not taken into account in our model30 or to methodological differences in the estimation of the time-series for predicted and observed cases (Supplementary Materials, sections S2–S4). In any case, this disparity caused the model to over-predict by two cases in July and August and under-predict by two cases in November and December, and model residuals were normally distributed (Figure S10) suggesting random errors in the model predictions. Unfortunately, temporal fits for Akonolinga could not be tested in Bankim, as environmental data in this region was only collected every three months, which precludes the fitting of robust mathematical models. Future studies are thus needed to assess the generalizability of our temporal results to other endemic regions with diverse envi-ronmental conditions. "
1691937,2," The time from infection to treatment in our best temporal fits was consistently 6 months. This implies that ecological processes that favour growth of MU in aquatic environments and boost its concentration at specific times of the year9 might result in an increase in human BU infections, on average, six months later. Nevertheless, individual variability around average values for the incubation period and time to seek treatment could influence the dynamics of the reconstructed time series and the relationships identified in the temporal model. In the absence of individual data for each patient’s incubation period and time to seek treatment for our 10-year time series, a reasonable approach is the use of average estimates for parametrization of deterministic models. Moreover, data from 2012 showed that the time to seek treatment for BU in Akonolinga hospital was relatively low thanks to active case finding from Médecins Sans Frontières in the region (median = 5 weeks; interquartile range = 3–12 weeks)30. Future extensions of this modelling approach could benefit from such individual information for the whole time series and from the use of stochastic models to assess the impact of variability in individual parameter values on model outcomes. "
1691937,3," At the spatial level, we show that MU presence is associated with BU incidence even at the very local scale within endemic regions. Previous studies have linked MU positivity in the environment and water bugs with BU prevalence8,18, suggesting that MU positivity in water bugs can differentiate between endemic and non-endemic areas18, and that environmental MU positivity may predict BU prevalence spatially8. Other studies have explored the theoretical implications of these routes of transmission in mathematical models31. However, due to data lim-itations, no studies have considered the contribution of environmental pathways while controlling for potential water bug transmission or vice versa. Because we systematically collected samples over space and time from the whole aquatic community and from water bugs, we were able to study both transmission routes simultaneously. We show that in our study regions, the environmental presence and concentration of MU in a water body can better predict BU incidence in surrounding populations than any of the variables suggestive of water bug transmission. While MU concentration shows a clear linear relationship with BU incidence, the best models suggest a saturation effect for the link between MU positivity and BU incidence. Thus expansion of MU in the environment may not increase human infectious without simultaneous increases in concentration. "
1691937,4," We use the positivity and concentration of MU in the whole community of aquatic organisms as proxies for direct environmental transmission, as they represent two ways of measuring spatio-temporal changes in MU envi-ronmental load. Although a diversity of samples has been used in the past to estimate MU environmental load, i.e water8,32,33, soil or mud33–35, aquatic plants8,12,35 and aquatic organisms8,11,18,19,33; it seems clear that communities of aquatic organisms are able to acquire MU from these multiple environmental matrices and transmit it through ecological networks to other aquatic organisms13,36. Aquatic communities are composed of organisms with mul-tiple feeding strategies such as filter feeders that filter water, herbivores that consume aquatic plants, scavengers that eat detritus, and predators that consume other organisms, creating multiple pathways for infection when MU is present in any of those environmental matrices. We thus consider that estimation of MU prevalence and concentration in the community as a whole should provide a good representation of MU environmental load in these various matrices and can represent appropriate proxies for measuring the risk of human infection with MU contaminated environments. "
1691937,5," Even though our results are clearly in favour of a higher contribution of environmental MU transmission, this should be taken with caution. A sensitivity analysis performed in the mathematical model shows that if the median time to seek treatment of BU patients was higher than the 1–4 month range that we initially considered based on our data, the water bug transmission could play a role, contributing up to 20% of the infections at spe-cific times of the year in the best model fit (Supplementary Materials, section S7). Furthermore, estimates of MU prevalence in water bugs of the families Belostomatidae and Naucoridae are subject to some uncertainty, due to smaller sample sizes and the presence of other hemipteran families in some of the positive pools tested. Although most hemipteran families found in aquatic sites from endemic regions are capable of biting and have been found positive to MU11,18, their role in transmission is less studied. Similar ecological studies on MU transmission may consider overrepresentation of these two families when performing PCR testing, in order to decrease such uncer-tainty. Finally, other transmission routes such as aerosols and the role of mosquitoes as vectors of MU have been previously proposed and are not considered here37,38. "
1691937,6," The extremely low incidence characteristic of the disease even in endemic regions (on the order of 2 cases/1,000/year in high risk areas), limits our ability to study predictors of BU indicence, since stochastic processes have a strong impact in the spatio-temporal dynamics of rare diseases39. Recent analyses of long time-series of BU cases in French Guiana40 and Cameroon30 suggest seasonal patterns in BU incidence and reveal persistent spatial clusters of cases over time that are associated with specific environmental traits41. This is consistent with ecological studies on MU, where similar spatio-temporal patterns are observed for the dynamics of the mycobacterium11,42. We benefit from these novel insights and attempt to overcome the issue of stochasticity in rare diseases by comparing our one-year environmental dataset with BU incidence in human populations from the previous 10 years. For this, we aggregate the human monthly data for the whole region, in order to obtain robust estimates for the temporal patterns, and then we aggregate the entire time-series at the spatial level, in order to obtain robust estimates for the geographical distribution of cases in the region. While an ideal approach would be to associate, for each point in time and space, MU in the environment with the respective BU incidence using stochastic models, the amount of data necessary to have reliable and sufficient estimates from environmental samples is not available today. Nevertheless, the present study uses one of the most exhaustive environmental datasets available today for MU research and reveals new and important insights on this mysterious disease. "
1691937,7," The results presented here represent a first step towards integrative disease prevention and could largely improve early detection of BU cases. If the concentration of MU DNA in the aquatic environment can predict spatial and temporal risk of BU emergence at a very local scale, it may be possible to predict the risk of disease emergence through systematic environmental screening of MU. Such a strategy could be used in combination with epide-miological research to identify potential MU transmission hotspots prior to prospective studies, or to control for BU environmental hazard when evaluating behavioural or socio-economic factors in case-control studies. Unfortunately, due to the limited resources and poor infrastructure in BU endemic settings, it is very unlikely that the national public health systems could afford such a screening strategy for disease control, either technically or financially. Unless cheaper and easier tools for environmental screening of MU become available, prevention and early detection of BU cases is likely to benefit the most from a better understanding of the environmental drivers of MU presence and concentration9. Such insight could help identify environmental proxies of MU dynamics over space and time at local and regional scales, allowing the development of early warning systems which could improve disease control."
1982497,0," The most common causes of a slower blood flow in CCSVI patients are the obstructed or malfunctioning valves (Figure 3). In our opinion, the main purpose of MRV is not to visualize such a valve, but to demonstrate the influence of such pathological structures on flow characteristics. In addition, MRV can demonstrate anatomical abnormalities (such as hypoplasia or agenesis of a vein) that may make endovascular treatment of CCSVI challenging or even impossible. The most common CCSVI pathology, namely the pathologic flow in the IJV, can be also detected with color Doppler sonography [21]. However, pathologic outflows or anatomical abnormalities in AV or brachiocephalic vein cannot be diagnosed by means of color Doppler sonography. Hence, MRV remains the only reliable diagnostic tool in case of these veins (Figures 4, ​,5).5). Importantly, a standard MRV with gadolinium contrast enhancement, which was used in our center initially, was not found very useful in the diagnostics of CCSVI pathologies. Probably, the advanced MRV sequences, with quantitative measuring of the blood flow, will be even more useful than our protocols. However, for the time being, there are no such widely accepted and standardized MRV protocols. Our MRV protocol is simple and very efficient in diagnosing CCSVI abnormalities. Moreover, it could be implemented in the majority of MR scanners, produced after 2005. "
1982497,1," Similarly to the already published four grades of pathologic outflow diagnosed with catheter venography, we herewith propose 4 MRV grades of CCSVI: mildly decreased flow – demonstrated by a mildly increased signal on coronal T2FatSat images; moderately decreased flow – demonstrated by a moderately increased signal on coronal T2FatSat images, and by a slightly decreased signal on axial 2DTOF images; highly decreased flow – demonstrated by a significantly increased signal on coronal T2FatSat images and by a significantly decreased signal on axial 2DTOF images; severely decreased flow – demonstrated by an increased signal on coronal T2FatSat images and by an almost totally decreased IJV signal on axial 2DTOF images (see our images at: http://ccsvimri.blogspot.com/). "
429330,0," The chosen setting, Bankim district in the Adamaoua region, contrasts with the previous study site. Akonolinga, the previous study site, was characterized by a relative homogeneity: 80% of the population belonged to the same ethnic group, the region was largely forested and water-related activities were centered on a major river, the Nyong [3]. By contrast, Bankim was home to numerous ethnic groups with wider variation in environmental, cultural and health practices. Bankim’s environment is a highly varied mosaic of savanna, mountain, and forests. Water-related activities took place in the Mappe´ reservoir, the Mbam River and many other smaller water bodies (Figure S1). Our rigorous sampling method, which used census data and repeated appointments with controls, allowed us to capture accurately the heterogeneities of populations and activities in Bankim and to minimize control recruitment associated biases [19]. Case recruitment was performed within the entire district and was not restricted to the most accessible areas. Similar to case-control studies on BU, the present study has several limits inherent in its methodology and context. First, even if we are confident that our sampling method prevented most sampling biases, memory bias could have occurred: cases were interviewed on their activities during the period preceding the onset of disease and could therefore remember them differently from controls, who were interviewed on their activities over the previous year. However, we included mainly cases with disease diagnoses during the two previous years. This ensured that cases and controls would recall their activities on similar time scales and minimized differential bias. Furthermore, having suffered Buruli ulcer disease could have influenced cases’ answers to questions, such as the occurrence of scratch wound as discussed below (rumination bias, [19]). However, most of our identified risk or protective factors are related to less subjective behavioral parameters, which are less likely to be influenced by the disease status. Finally, this study was performed in a region that is distant from national or regional level healthcare facilities, and where the disease was only recently reported. But in 2007, because of the increasing number of cases, Bankim health personnel were trained at the national Buruli ulcer reference hospital in Ayos on case detection, systematic recording and basic management of cases according to WHO guidelines. These trained personnel imple- mented these practices in the district. During the period of the present laboratory case confirmation was set up although only a few cases were confirmed microbiologically. However, clinical diagnosis has been demon- strated to be highly specific when performed by trained health personnel, so that we are confident that almost all clinically- diagnosed Buruli cases were true cases [20]. In a previous study in study, a systematic procedure for Wound Care, Bed Nets and Buruli Ulcer in Cameroon Akonolinga, Cameroon, analysis of probable and confirmed cases yielded the same risk factors as confirmed cases only [3]. "
429330,1," Protection using a bed net. This the association between bed net use and protection against BU, previously shown in Akonolinga, in central Cameroon [3]. study confirms The previous study in Akonolinga had shown that the strong association between use of a bed net and protection against BU (OR [95%CI] = 0.4 [0.2–0.8] persisted between cases and controls within the same household (OR [95%CI] = 0.1 [0.320.03]), suggesting that it was not confounded by socio-economic status. A larger proportion of adults was included in the present study which made it more difficult to recruit siblings as familial controls. Statistical power is consequently low in the family-matched case- control study. However, use of a bed net still presents a protective effect in this sub-study, which, although not significant, has the same magnitude (OR [95%CI] = 0.4 [0.1–1.4]) as in the community-matched study (OR [95%CI] = 0.4 [0.2–0.9]). While socio-economical status might have confounded the association in the community-matched study, if for instance, participants using bed nets were less likely to have activities exposing them to M. ulcerans, it is unlikely to be the case in the family-matched study. Indeed, in this study, cases and their familial controls share the same socio-economical level. Here we demonstrate that the association between bed net use and protection against BU withstands generalization in a different climatic, geographic, environmental, and ethnic context. This replicative study greatly increases the positive predictive value of the association between bed net use and decreased risk of BU [15]. Few epidemiological studies have investigated the possible role of a bed net as a protective factor against BU in Africa. In Ghana, no significant association was found between bed net use and protection against BU, but the proportion of bed net users in the general population was low (25%), and the 116 pairs of cases and controls only yielded a power 67% to show an OR of 0.4 or less [6]. Furthermore, categories of bed net use grouped ‘‘sometimes’’ and ‘‘always’’ together, probably because of overall infrequent use. In our study, always using a bed net was protective, while sometimes using one was not. Out of two risk-factor studies in Benin, one did not address the question of bed net use [5], while the other showed a small risk increase for bed net users in univariate analysis which disappeared when adjusting for other variables in a multivariate model [2]. The preventive fraction for systematic bed net use was 32% in this study, and reached 43% in the previous study performed in Akonolinga [3]. If this association proves to be causal, bed net generalization could represent a significant mean of protection against the disease that could lead up to one third reduction in the number of cases. The protective effect of bed nets could result from two different mechanisms. First, using a bed net could protect from direct inoculation of M. ulcerans by an insect vector. This hypothesis is consistent with several results from environmental studies. In Australia, M. ulcerans infection is now considered a zoonosis transmitted from possum to human by mosquitoes [21,22]. Secondly, bed nets could provide a protection by preventing unspecific insect bites. These bites can lead to small lesions after being scratched which would enable M. ulcerans to enter the skin when in contact with contaminated environment. Occurrence of scratch wounds following insect bites was indeed associated with an increased risk of disease in our study. This factor was statistically independent of bed net use as shown by the persistence of both variables in the final model. This result suggests that both risk factors may act independently, some insect bites being not preventable by bed nets, for instance those occurring at day time. The association between bed net use and protection against BU underlines the need to broaden environmental studies to aerial insects and to the domestic environment. It would be relevant to assess the presence of M. ulcerans in Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes which are important in Africa. Studies on distribution, abundance and M. ulcerans positivity of water bugs should not be restricted to the aquatic environment and seek these insects in the domestic environment. "
429330,2," Protection from adequate wound hygiene. The strongest protective association was linked to using soap to cleanse wounds. This variable summed up others that implied practices of proper wound care: use of alcohol and frequent bandage changing were also associated with protection, and usually concerned the same people. This association of a decreased risk of Buruli ulcer and good hygiene practices has been found in Ghana [6], Benin [2] and Cameroon [3], indicating that such practices might be one of the most powerful way of avoiding this disease. This also indicates that while some insects may transmit M. ulcerans, other transmission mechanisms are likely to coexist that involve wounds as a port of entry, such as contamination of open inoculation of M. ulcerans by a wounds by water, or direct wounding object. Several mechanisms could explain the decreased risk of disease associated with wound hygiene. Clean wounds heal faster and could be less likely to become a port of entry for the microbe. Frequent wound cleansing could also prevent the survival of the microbe in the skin: since the initial mycobacterial inoculum is expected to be low (3 months median incubation time, [23]) and since the growth rate is very slow, repeated disinfection of skin lesions, or frequent bodily cleansing could help to prevent microbe colonization and subsequent infection, independently of the actual transmission route. Onset of Buruli ulcer disease after sustaining a wound was reported by 9 cases out of 77 analyzed in this study. This result may well be subject to memory bias. Even so, the role of wounds in the transmission of M. ulcerans infection has received little, if any, attention. Symmetrically, the potential role of good hygienic practices has remained poorly investigated by the research community and remains absent from official recommendations, including the WHO BU factsheet [24]. Hygiene-related protective factors have been documented repeatedly and are thus highly relevant to public health. Using published data, we have estimated the preventive fraction for the use of toilet soap for bathing in previous studies and found was 41% in Ghana [6] and 65% in Benin [2]. The preventive fraction for using soap, antibiotic powder or health center care to treat injuries was 53% in Benin [2], while the preventive fraction for using alcohol to treat wounds was 26% in Cameroon [3]. In this study, the preventive fraction of soap use for cleansing wounds was 34%. While the role of insects in BU transmission remains the cause of much debate and methodological interrogations [25], clarifying the role of hygiene does not seem to have elicited much attention even though most studies confirm its importance. Good hygienic practices could potentially have a major role in community prevention programs. "
429330,3," Protection from growing cassava. Our final model also contains an unanticipated protective association with growing cassava. It had also been found in univariate analysis in Ghana [6]. The link between cassava and M. ulcerans infection is not obvious; we therefore suspect in both cases this factor could be associated with an environmental parameter that was not captured by our questionnaires. The main food crop in Bankim is maize, that Wound Care, Bed Nets and Buruli Ulcer in Cameroon which is highly water-demanding, and Bankim farmers report that cassava grows better in dry, higher grounds. We therefore hypothesize that people growing cassava may work in less swampy, thus less risky areas. Furthermore, bitter cassava is favoured by farmers because insects are less likely to attack it than sweet cassava. Bitter cassava contains toxic cyanoside compounds, and its preparation requires that the tubers be soaked in water, ground to flour and then sundried for several days. During this preparation process, the soaking and drying produce a very intense smell which may possibly repel insects from the domestic area where the preparation takes place. Of note are also the several univariate associations found between growing certain food crops and a decreased risk of disease. These associations suggest that nutritional status may possibly increase a person’s ability to resist M. ulcerans infection. Because this study is the first to show that this factor is significantly associated with a decreased risk of Buruli ulcer disease, we consider that further investigations on the agricultural and nutritional practices are needed before drawing conclusions about its possible role in prevention. "
429330,4," Bathing for hygiene in the Mbam river was associated with an increased risk of disease. These baths involved people spending long amounts of time near the river for their farming activities and eventually dwelling there during the rainy cultivation season where the waters are high and the banks swampy. Risk increase did not concern leisure baths in the same river, which only took place in the shallow waters during the dry season. This finding is in accordance with numerous previous identifying slow flowing rivers and stagnant waters as an important source of contamination. The identification of the Mbam river as a risk factor rather than the Mappe´ reservoir seems at first counter- intuitive, but the reservoir is probably not the direct source of every contamination: some patients had no history of contact with the Mappe´ lake waters and highest prevalences of BU were not recorded in the fishing settlements on the lake shore but in the villages located between the lake and the Mbam river (figure S1). Of note, M. ulcerans DNA positive water bugs were captured in domestic water collections as well as in the Mappe´ lake in 2008 [16]. The importance of the peri-domestic water collections as a source of M. ulcerans infections remains to be evaluated in terms of M. ulcerans presence throughout the year as well as potential vectors or reservoirs breeding sites. Captures targeting water bugs indicated important seasonal variations of abundance and positivity [8], which warrants regular follow-up of microbe and insect populations. The dam construction may have contributed to BU expansion suitable for proliferation, by providing a broader habitat dissemination and/or survival of M. ulcerans, one of its hosts, or an eventual vector. The dam construction in this region impacted drastically on endemicity of onchocerciasis and loasis [26] as well as schistosomiasis (Mouchet F, personal communication). Increase in BU disease may also result from increased exposure to the environment surrounding the Mbam River where relocated villagers exploit new fields after the dam construction. The second risk factor identified in this study is more difficult to interpret. Reporting occurrence of scratch wounds after being bitten by an insect was found associated with Buruli ulcer disease. This could be seen as an indication that insect bites are involved in the transmission, either through an insect vector or through unspecific skin lesions from scratching representing a port of entry for M. ulcerans. We would however recommend considering this factor with great caution, as it was only reported and actual sensitivity to insect bites was not assessed. Furthermore, BU cases often reported having suffered intense itching before the onset of the lesion, which they often attributed to an insect bite. This event may have led cases to report being more sensitive to insect bites than controls. Finally, several risk factors commonly evoked for BU did not present statistically significant associations with the disease in this study. Statistical power was probably insufficient to investigate properly several associations, such as education level (very low) and short clothing related associations (infrequently used for farm work or fishing). Bankim environment’s heterogeneity probably prevented us from identifying major water sources of exposure: there is a large number of water bodies, and people change both water-related activities and locations throughout the year because these water sources dry up during the dry season. This may explain why in this study, four behavioral factors and only one location-dependent factor had statistically significant associations with BU in the final model."
193334,0," Our results confirmed our first hypothesis that the patients with TGA having IJV stenosis/compression at various segments would exhibit significantly lower total FVs in the bilateral IJVs and VVs resulting in important consequences than that exhibited by the control subjects. More importantly, our findings are consistent with our second hypothesis that the prevalence of right IJV non-patency at various segments during the VM would be significantly higher in the study subjects with IJV stenosis/compression at various segments; and therefore, would be higher in the TGA patients than that in the controls, which supports our novel hypothesis of venous pathogenesis involved in the TGA attacks (16). Specifically, an insufficient IJV patency prevents the release of increased intracranial pressure and venous congestion/hypertension in the basilar plexus and cavernous sinus caused by VM-like maneuvers. Moreover, venous stasis and occlusion may cause constriction of cerebral arterioles (16), which further compromises cerebral hemodynamics. "
193334,1," Venous Flow Velocity and FV in IJVs This study, our previous study (20), and other studies (22, 23) all revealed that the IJV or BCV compression and stenosis significantly reduce the IJV FVs. These result in the venous drainage being routed through less efficient alternative routes, such as the tortuous path through the spinovertebral venous plexus. This obstruction of the venous drainage may also induce changes in the arterial blood flow, such as arterial constriction, through the venoarterial reflex (25). Such changes may explain the observation in our previous studies (21, 24) that, the patients with transient monocular blindness without carotid stenosis exhibited increased downstream resistance of the retrobulbar arteries (i.e., ophthalmic artery, posterior ciliary artery, and central artery) in association with significantly increased prevalence of compression/stenosis in the bilateral IJVs (26). In this study, we did not measure the venous FV in the spinovertebral venous plexus, because it is undetectable by the ultrasound; therefore, we do not know the changes in the total venous drainage from the bilateral TSs, though the patients exhibited significantly lower total FV in the bilateral IJVs and VVs. "
193334,2," Prevalence of IJV Non-patency During the VM Our results supported our second hypothesis that the prevalence of IJV non-patency during the VM would be higher in the TGA patients than that in the controls. We observed a significant difference in the prevalence of right IJV non-patency (patients: 32.1%; controls: 11.6%; p = 0.0128) as compared to that for the left IJV non- patency (patients: 49.4%; controls: 37.2%). An abundance of evidence indicates that VM-induced pressure from the chest and abdomen is mainly transmitted to the intracranial compartment via the epidural venous plexus or vertebral venous plexus. Orthograde IJV outflows emerging shortly after the beginning of the VM, thus, serve as a mechanism for regulating the intracranial pressure and equalizing the pressure within the venous system (10, 11, 14, 16). Our findings indicate that the patients with TGA may experience defective intracranial pressure regulation during the VM-like movements. As described earlier, we restricted our definition of IJV non-patency to complete absence of the IJV drainage at the J3 or J2 segment during the first 10 s of the VM; but, this consideration regarding the IJV drainage might be unexhaustive. Several patients with partial or limited IJV drainage were excluded from this definition, which may explain why we observed a lower prevalence of IJV non-patency during the VM. Further research is needed to develop a more sensitive and specific definition of IJV non-patency during the VM. "
193334,3," Incompetence of Jugular Venous Valves Cerebral venous congestion/hypertension, which results from the venous reflux during the VM consequent to the IJVVI, is linked to TGA (4–6). However, previous ultrasound studies using either retrograde flow (27) or air bubbles (28) during the VM explained the involvement of only the proximal region of the IJV in the IJVVI, ignoring the rest of the IJV and the entire BCV, and possibly missing other important IJV/BCV abnormalities. Unsurprisingly, previous ultrasound and non-contrast MRA results have not supported a causal relationship between the IJVVI and TGA (7–9). Other than the IJVVI, we have previously described three ultrasound patterns of IJV abnormalities in the patients with TGA: (i) an isolated reverse flow in the left jugular vein branch (JB), (ii) a segmental reverse flow in the left distal IJV, and (iii) a continuous reverse flow in the left IJV and JB (29). All the three of these IJV patterns are suggestive of the venous outflow obstruction or compression/stenosis of the left BCV (29). Similar to other studies (4–6), even in this study, the overall prevalence of IJVVI was higher in the TGA patients than that in the controls (Table 2); but, the prevalence was higher in the left IJV only, and not in the right IJV. Furthermore, we found that the prevalence of IJVVI was significantly higher in the individuals with left BCV compression/stenosis. This suggests that the IJVVI might occur secondary to the BCV compression/stenosis on the left side. The fact that the IJVVI was more frequently observed on the right side, as reported in other studies (28), raises the question of whether the jugular venous valves are vulnerable in cases of IJV compression/stenosis due to pressure imbalances across the valves or whether the previous air bubble methodology overestimated the IJVVI prevalence (30). Further research is needed to address this question. "
193334,4," Assessments of IJV Compression With Different Imaging Modalities It is worth mentioning that despite the patients exhibiting reduced flow velocities and FVs in each of the segments of the bilateral IJVs, the diameters of their IJV segments were comparable to that of the controls (Table 2). Moreover, the patients' right IJVs were slightly wider than that of the controls. This may be partially explained by the Bernoulli's equation, which states that the pressure in the venous lumen is inversely proportional to the flow rate, so that the lumen diameter may be enlarged with flow stasis resulting from the venous stenosis/compression. As described earlier, the FV of the IJV decreases in cases of IJV or BCV stenosis/compression (20, 22, 23). However, discrepancies in the diagnosis of IJV compression/stenosis may be observed due to different types of venous examination (31). Catheter venography has been traditionally regarded as the gold standard for diagnosing venous disorders involving compression/stenosis, but it does not measure the flow velocity or FV; hence, it cannot prove or disprove the MRI or ultrasound findings that indicate decreased IJV FV resulting from compression/stenosis. "
193334,5," Study Limitations This study has several limitations, particularly regarding the use of ultrasound to study the IJV. First, there are no ideal, fixed locations for measuring the CSA and TAMV in the J2 and J3 segments; and these measurements may vary if the IJVs are non-uniform in diameter, which may occur in the cases where the IJV is affected by segmental dilatation, narrowing, or compression. However, the FV was calculated by multiplying the TAMV by the CSA, and it was theoretically correct according to the Bernoulli's equation. We measured the CSA and TAMV at the widest available lumen of the J2 and J3 segments to minimize the bias. This allowed us to detect the differences in both the FVs and TAMVs between the patients and controls. Second, it is unexhaustive to consider complete absence of IJV drainage during the VM while explaining IJV non-patency. Several of our subjects exhibited limited or intermittent flow, which suggests partial IJV blockage. However, we excluded these subjects from our definition of IJV non-patency, which may have caused us to underestimate the prevalence of IJV non-patency during the VM. Third, left BCV blockage may disappear during deep inspiration (15), which usually precedes the VM; hence, paradoxical reopening of the left BCV and left IJV occurs during the VM. This causes further underestimation of the prevalence of non-patency."
432326,0," Due to the limitations of conventional typing methods for the differentiation of strains belong- ing to the highly monomorphic African M. ulcerans population, use of WGS was suggested to reach sufficient analytical depth for molecular epidemiology studies [32]. Here our comparative genomic analysis of strains from two geographically separated BU endemic areas of Cameroon, the Mapé and the Nyong river basins, identified two phylogenetically distinct lineages of M. ulcerans. These data support previous findings that the spread of local clonal lin- eages between endemic areas only rarely occurs [13,14]. In a previous IS element—SNP based typing study most strains from the central region of Cameroon had the same SNP types as strains from neighbouring Gabon. The IS element—SNP type found in a strain from the Mapé river basin was also present across entire Central and West-Africa leading to the hypothesis that this lineage represents the founder of the other observed IS element—SNP types [15]. Our WGS analysis showed that the strains from the Mapé river basin are in fact more closely related to the M. ulcerans strain circulating in Ghana and Benin than the strains belonging to the Nyong river basin lineage. Additional WGS data with strains from all BU endemic African countries are required to shed more light on the spread and evolution of M. ulcerans in Africa and the origin of the locally observed two distinct Cameroonian lineages. "
432326,1," Analysis of the pairwise SNPs distance and nucleotide diversity distribution revealed a lower genetic diversity among the Mapé river basin strains than among the Nyong river basin strains. Epidemiological data suggest that M. ulcerans has expanded in the Mapé river area more recently than in the Nyong river basin. Descriptions of BU cases in the Nyong river basin exist since 1969 [17]. In contrast, clinically suspected cases of BU in the Mapé river area have been reported first only in 2004 [33]. While the disease may have preexisted there, epidemio- logical data strongly indicate that BU incidence has recently increased in the Mapé river basin [16,33]. Recent expansion of a clone may thus explain the more limited genetic diversity of the M. ulcerans lineage present in the Mapé river basin. It was speculated, that this expansion was associated with environmental changes caused by the damming of the Mapé river in 1989 [16,33]. Although it has been shown that cases associate more with the Mbam river as opposed to the Mapé dam directly [11,16], damming may have had an indirect effect on groundwater level and stagnant water bodies in the area. "
432326,2," We have compared the genome sequences of strains isolated at different time points over the course of the BU infection of three patients. In only one case, we detected a single SNP in one of the isolates compared to the strain isolated earlier from the same patient. It is not possible to conclude whether this observed single polymorphism is related to a re-infection by a variant strain or to a point mutation that occurred either in the patient or during the in vitro cultivation. However, these data support the expectation of a low mutation rate in M. ulcerans. "
432326,3," Our analysis shows that WGS is an important tool for studying the local diversity and popu- lation structure of M. ulcerans in endemic areas and for resolving the evolutionary history of the pathogen. A combination of phylogenetic analysis with geographical information on the patient’s home at the time of disease onset did not reveal a clear distribution pattern of the ge- netic variants. This may in part be related to the limited resolution of the comparative genomic analysis performed here. Resolution of the WGS typing could be further increased by inclusion of repetitive regions of the genome and the virulence plasmid that we so far excluded from the analysis, such as the IS2404 and PE/PPE regions. On the other hand, our sero-epidemiological analyses have provided evidence that exposure to M. ulcerans does not primarily occur at the homes of patients [34], but may rather be associated with more peripheral environmental water contact sites. Furthermore, for patients from the Mapé river basin it has been found that many of them move over long distances (in some cases >15 km) from their homes towards the Mbam river for their farming activities [11,16]. For genomic epidemiology studies it may there- fore be necessary to establish detailed individual movement and environmental water contact patterns to follow the spatial-temporal spread of genetic variants."
2547425,0," In this case-control study, involving four types of MS patients with matched healthy controls, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that CCSVI is associated with multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, given the relatively high age of the patient population in our study the data substantiate the view [30]–[32] that CCSVI is not a late secondary phenomenon of MS and is not associated with disability. Using Doppler ultrasound only one subject (with primary progressive MS) fulfilled the minimum criteria established by Zamboni et al [5], [9] for having CCSVI. However, at this juncture it is important to note that the “Zamboni criteria” as well as the proposed cut-offs are arbitrary in number and essentially an unproven hypothesis [33]. MRI quantitative flow assessment of extra- and intra-cranial venous blood flow revealed no clinically significant differences between the MS subjects or healthy matched controls. We did not find any evidence of CCSVI in any of the healthy subjects. Thus the data from this study do not support the existence of CCSVI. "
2547425,1," Our data are consistent with several recent studies [12], [14], [17], [21], [24], [30], [32], [33]which found no evidence for CCSVI in MS patients using ultrasonographic techniques. The results from these studies are in marked contrast to those reported by Zamboni et al [5]–[7] who found that all MS patients exhibited CCSVI. In the ultrasound study by Zivadinov et al [18] the prevalence of CCSVI in MS subjects was 56%, an intermediate between the results reported by Zamboni and the results reported here and others [14], [17], [21], [24], [30], [32]. However, in the study by Zivadinov et al [18] 23% of the healthy control group were also reported to have CCSVI. "
2547425,2," MRI techniques were not originally used to define CCSVI, but when they have been employed to examine extra-cranial venous flow in MS patients [13], [15], [16], [21] the data are not supportive of Zamboni's hypothesis. The results from our own MRI assessments are consistent with these other studies in that intra- and extra-cranial venous flow was not significantly different between cases and controls. The observation that right IJV flow was consistently higher than that in the left IJV is in accord with previously published data in both healthy [34] and MS subjects [21]. When one examines this flow asymmetry there is no significant difference in the differential between right minus left IJV flows for cases versus controls. Finally, on radiological examination of the contrast enhanced MRVs we found no evidence of structural abnormalities in the venous architecture of the extra-cranial vessels between cases and controls which is consistent with previous findings [12], [21], [35]. Collectively, these data serve to underscore the absence of any significant cerebrospinal venous abnormalities in MS subjects. "
2547425,3," It is well recognized that ultrasonography is an operator-dependent technique and in studies utilizing ultrasound to evaluate CCSVI there are significant differences between the methodologies used and protocols described [12], [19], [20], [36]. In acknowledging this potential limitation, our vascular ultrasonographers and an ultrasound radiologist spent time with Zamboni's group in Ferrara, Italy to observe the technique that was used to define CCSVI. "
2547425,4," Ultrasound is also subject to anatomical limitations. Intrathoracic vessels are obscured by bony anatomy and are not accessible. The deep cerebral veins that are accessible have limited fields of view. Despite this the sonographers were able to consistently demonstrate a DCV using the transtemporal approach. Furthermore, the extracranial veins respond to respiration, posture changes and breathing artifacts which demonstrate variable flow patterns making hemodynamic assessment limited and the evaluation of stenosis difficult. We are however confident in our ultrasound results since the MRI determinations that were performed on the same day as the ultrasonography are in accord that there were no significant differences in venous flow between the MS patients and their matched controls. "
2547425,5," It thus appears that operator-induced venous abnormalities may account for the prior observation of CCSVI amongst patients with MS being investigated with ultrasound. We believe that the positive ultrasound findings in some previous studies [5]–[8], [18] reflect low specificity with the procedure, likely the product of operator-induced artifact. This would explain the almost bimodal heterogeneity for observing CCSVI demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis [19]. It is also unlikely that there was operator-related poor sensitivity for detecting CCSVI in the study that we conducted given that the MRI measures of flow in the study correlate well with ultrasound measurements of flow that were obtained in the same patient. "
2547425,6," Another limitation of the study was our inability to blind the ultrasonographers regarding whether a subject was a MS patient or a control (e.g. MS patients may have required some assistance with mobility). In studies such as this one, an unblinding bias would be expected to increase the chance of observing an association. Given that no association was observed the lack of blinding appears to have been inconsequential. The radiologists reading either the ultrasound or MRI images were blinded to whether the participant was a MS patient or control subject, as well as to the results of the other imaging test. While viewing the MRI might reveal that a subject has MS (e.g. plaques being present) the fact that no association was observed between MRI flow abnormalities and MS patients in the study suggests that unblinding was not a problem. "
