2004704,0,"Daily monitoring revealed that two of the six cattle had slightly elevated temperatures of 39.1 °C and 39.4 °C on day 1 post-inoculation. Both the animals had no appetite on that specific day but returned to normal by day 2 post-inoculation. No further signs of distress were noted for any of the animals throughout the remainder of the trial. Blood samples were collected daily from the animals from day 1 to day 39 post-inoculation and viraemia was detected between day 2 and day 32 in four of the animals and in the two other animals viraemia could be detected until 39 days post-inoculation using virus isolation. Seroconversion was confirmed using a commercially available competitive ELISA (Veterinary Medical Research and Development, Centurion, SA); all cattle tested negative on day 0 and seropositive on days 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21."
2004704,1,Parental strains from the vaccine bottle and the BTV 4 field strain each demonstrated unique electrophoretic profiles and it was possible to distinguish between genome segments based on their PAGE migration profiles as illustrated in Figure 2. Eleven samples were identified as possible reassortant viruses. Full-length sequences of all these samples were submitted to GenBank (Bioproject number: PRJNA287219) and sequence data (with accession numbers) were published by Van den Bergh et al. (2016).
2004704,2,"Comparison of genomic sequences of each of the suspected reassortant isolates (n = 11) with the vaccine strains and the BTV 4 wild-type revealed that nine of the 11 samples analysed clustered with the wild-type BTV 4 strain in which all 10 segments were identical to the 10 segments of BTV 4. Two of the viral isolates obtained from blood samples (samples 2b and 6b, Figure 3), however, grouped with the BTV 9 vaccine strain. Nine of the segments of these isolates clustered with BTV MLV 9 with segment 8 as an exception that clustered with another vaccine strain from Bottle B, BTV 8 (Figure 4)."
342394,0,"The serological evidence of BTV infection was observed in 58 out of 299 cows accounting for a 19.4% prevalence rate among cattle in North Kordufan State. The highest and the lowest rate of infections were recorded in Shiekan and Elnnuhud, (15%) and (27.5%), respectively. Initially, univariate analysis using Chi-square test was conducted for the association between the potential risk factors and BTV infection. The results of the univariate analysis are presented in (Table ​(Table1).1). The results obtained from the univariable model were re-entered into a final multivariate model using logistic regression analysis. In the final models, a variable with a P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The individual risk factors attributes indicated that older cattle (>2 years of age) were four times more likely to be infected with BTV (OR = 4.30, CI = 1.941-9.467, p-value = 0.01). Weak and emaciated cattle were almost 3 times more likely to be at risk for contracting BTV infection (OR = 2.925, CI = 1.146-7.606, p-value = 0.025). The management risk factor attributes showed that the preventive measures, such as routine application of insecticide in the selected herds and spraying or dipping decreased the odds for bluetongue seropositivity by 7 times compared to non sprayed cattle (OR = 7.408, CI = 3-111-17.637, p-value = 0.01). In contrast, there was no significant difference between BTV seropositive cattle and other individual or management risk factors included in the study such as, animal sex, animal source, grazing system, other animals in the herd, herd size, farm yard, milk production, history of diseases and localities. The results are shown in (Table ​(Table22)."
2087253,0,"Safety of test series of the bivalent live cultural vaccine against BTV Other than a relatively mild fever (40.3–40.8 °C) for 2–4 days and swelling at the site of vaccination which resolved within 2–3 days, the animals developed no clinical signs after vaccination (Table ​(Table2).2). These results indicate that this vaccine is generally safe for sheep."
2087253,1,"Reversion to virulence Both strains induced viremia in susceptible animals (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). During the passages in sheep, the BTV titer was 1.16 ± 0.16 log10 TCID50/mL at the first passage, decreasing to 0.83 ± 0.08 and 0.92 ± 0.08 log10 TCID50/mL with subsequent passages (P ≤ 0.001) (10 total)."
2087253,2,"The attenuated virus showed no pathogenic properties after its intravenous administration to sheep, and all the animals remained healthy during the observation period (30 days)."
2087253,3,"Neutralizing antibody titers One week after vaccination, all the sheep had detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies, measured with a SNT, with mean titers (log10) ranging from 1.1 (for BTV-4) to 1.25 (for BTV-16) at 7 days after-vaccination (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2). Four weeks after vaccination, all the vaccinated animals had even higher levels of neutralizing antibodies: 4.0–4.8 log2 at 28 days and 1.8–2.0 log2 at 360 days (Fig. ​(Fig.22)."
2087253,4,The levels of NA in the sera of the immunized sheep differed significantly for both serotypes from day 7 to day 360 (P ≤ 0.0001).
2087253,5,"Group-specific antibody titers A graphical summary of the percentage inhibition (IP) results are given for each group in Fig. ​Fig.3.3. All sheep were seronegative before vaccination and the control sheep remained seronegative in all assays until challenge. After vaccination, the percentage inhibition decreased dramatically. The optical densities of specific antibodies decreased throughout the duration of the study, from IP < 8 ± 3.07 at day 28, to IP < 16.5 ± 4.95 at day 90, and IP < 46.25 ± 6.40 at day 360."
2087253,6,"Clinical protection following challenge Seven days after immunization, the animals developed protective immunity against BTV (Fig. ​(Fig.4a).4a). However, the vaccinated animals were insufficiently protected from challenge because they developed clinical signs of bluetongue, with an average score of 10 points. The unvaccinated control animals also developed clinical signs, with an average score of 20.8 points, so the difference in the mean scores was 10.8 points. At 14, 90, and 270 days after immunization, strong protective responses developed against BTV-4 and BTV-16 (Fig. 4b, c). The vaccinated animals showed a slight increase in body temperature after challenge, whereas the unvaccinated animals developed typical clinical signs of the disease. At 360 days after immunization, one vaccinated sheep showed an increase in body temperature of 41.5 °C for 2 days after challenge, which then returned to normal (Fig. ​(Fig.4d).4d). The vaccinated animals had an average clinical score of one point after challenge, whereas the unvaccinated animals had an average score of 27 points, indicating the high protective activity of the test vaccine."
761719,0,"Seroprevalence of bluetongue in west and northwest was shown in Table 1. The results showed that the seropositive rate in sheep over the whole study area was 40.87%. Presence of anti-bluetongue antibodies was found highest in west. The highest prevalence of antibodies was in West Azerbaijan (64.86%), and lower (23.77%) was in Ardabil (Table 1)."
921211,0,"BTV8ΔNS4 is attenuated in experimentally infected sheep. In a previous study, we showed that a BTV8 NS4 deletion mutant (BTV8ΔNS4) is as virulent as BTV8wt in experimental mouse models of infection (8). Here, we wanted to determine whether NS4 influenced virulence in sheep, the natural host of BTV infection. Therefore, we experimentally infected sheep with BTV8wt or BTV8ΔNS4. Sheep infected with BTV8wt showed an elevation of body temperature from day 6 to day 8 p.i. (Fig. 1, top). BTV RNA was detectable at day 4 p.i. and reached a plateau from days 6 to 10 p.i., followed by a slow decrease. Viremia remained detectable until the end of the experiment. In contrast, animals infected by BTV8ΔNS4 did not develop pyrexia and displayed a delayed onset and lower levels of viremia. BTV RNA was below the detection level in 4 of the 5 inoculated sheep at 4 weeks p.i., when the experiment was stopped (Fig. 1, middle). Between days 4 and 28 p.i., the average levels of BTV RNA were between 102- and 105-fold higher in sheep infected with BTV8wt than in those infected with BTV8ΔNS4. As expected, all BTV-infected animals developed neutralizing antibodies from day 7 p.i. (Fig. 1, bottom). Altogether, these data show that BTV8ΔNS4 is attenuated in sheep and suggest that NS4 is a virulence factor in vivo."
921211,1,"Replication kinetics of BTV8wt and BTV8ΔNS4 in primary ovine endothelial cells and human A549 cells. We showed previously that BTV8ΔNS4 replicates as efficiently as BTV8wt in immortalized cell lines, such as hamster BSR and sheep CPT-Tert cells (8), but these cell lines do not possess an intact IFN response to viral infections (44, 45). Hence, we compared the replication kinetics of BTV8wt and BTV8ΔNS4 in primary ovEC. BTV8wt reached titers approximately 20-fold higher than those of BTV8ΔNS4 at 72 h p.i. (Fig. 2A). Similarly, BTV8wt reached titers nearly 60-fold higher than those of BTV8ΔNS4 in the IFN-competent human cell line A549 (Fig. 2A). These data demonstrate that the presence of NS4 confers a replication advantage on BTV8 in cells that are capable of mounting an antiviral response."
921211,2,"NS4 inhibits IFN release, but not virus sensing, in infected cells. Given the data obtained as described above and the previously published observation that NS4 confers a replication advantage on BTV in cells pretreated with IFN (8), we next sought to determine whether NS4 impacted the level of IFN released into the supernatant of infected cells. Primary ovEC were infected at an MOI of 4 with either BTV8wt or BTV8ΔNS4. At 16 h p.i., the level of IFN in the cell culture medium was measured using an IFN protection assay. BTV8ΔNS4-infected cells had, on average, 13 times more IFN (P < 0.001) in their supernatants than BTV8wt-infected cells (Fig. 2B)."
921211,3,"These results could potentially be explained by NS4 affecting either the sensing of viral infection or transcription and/or the synthesis/secretion of IFN into the supernatant. The first step in IFN-β expression is the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by various host pattern recognition receptors, which results in the translocation of the transcription factors IRF-3 and NF-κB into the nucleus (37). In order to determine whether NS4 impacted supernatant levels of IFN by interfering with this process, we infected A549 cells at an MOI of 4 for 16 h and assessed the nuclear translocation of IRF-3 and NF-κB by confocal microscopy. The cellular localization of IRF-3 and NF-κB in mock-infected cells was exclusively cytoplasmic (Fig. 3), while stimulation with tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-α) used as a positive control resulted in nuclear translocation of NF-κB in essentially 100% of the cells (not shown). In contrast, between 25 and 35% of cells infected by BTV8wt showed translocation of IRF-3 and NF-κB into the nucleus. BTV8ΔNS4 was found to induce levels of translocation similar to those of BTV8wt, suggesting that NS4 does not prevent either PAMP recognition by the host cells or translocation of IRF-3 and NF-κB. NS2 immunolabeling confirmed similar levels of infection in cells infected with BTV8wt or BTV8ΔNS4 (Fig. 3)."
921211,4,"NS4 downregulates IFN-β and ISG mRNA levels. Next, we carried out RNA-seq analysis of IFN-competent A549 cells infected with either BTV8wt or BTV8ΔNS4 in order to further characterize the activity of NS4. Mock-infected A549 cells were used as negative controls. Libraries were prepared from nascent RNA metabolically labeled with a uracil analogue for 90 min at 12 h p.i. (Fig. 4A) and sequenced on an Ion Proton sequencer (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher). On average, 64.58 million reads per sample were generated (Phred quality > 20). We found 2,863 differentially expressed genes in cells infected by BTV8wt compared to mock-infected cells, of which 1,055 were downregulated and 1,808 were upregulated (Fig. 4B). In comparison, fewer genes (n = 2,292) were found to be differentially expressed in cells infected by BTV8ΔNS4 than in mock-infected cells, with 752 of them being downregulated and 1,540 upregulated. The entire list of differentially expressed genes in BTV8wt and BTV8ΔNS4-infected cells is presented in Tables S1 to S3 in the supplemental material. The CH25H gene (encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase; a known interferon-stimulated gene [ISG]) was found to be the most upregulated gene in BTV8ΔNS4-infected cells. A total of 117 genes were upregulated in BTV8ΔNS4-infected cells compared to BTV8wt-infected cells (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). Of these 117 genes, 102 were either IFN genes or ISGs, according to the Interferome database (63). IFN-β, IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, and IFN-λ3 genes were among the top 6 upregulated genes in BTV8ΔNS4-infected cells (87- to 136-fold more than in mock-infected cells) (Table 1). Interestingly, more genes were strongly upregulated (fold change > 32) in BTV8ΔNS4 (n = 33) than in BTV8wt-infected cells (n = 7). These genes included MX1 and -2; interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), -2, and -3; and OASL genes and other well-characterized ISGs. However, all 33 of the genes highly upregulated in BTV8ΔNS4-infected cells were also upregulated (albeit at a lower level) in BTV8wt-infected cells (Table 1). The IFN-β gene, for example, was also upregulated (17-fold) in BTV8wt-infected cells. No major differences in the levels of expression in BTV8wt- and BTV8ΔNS4-infected cells were observed for the genes with the highest levels of downregulation (Table 2). We validated the RNA-seq analysis by qRT-PCR on selected genes found to be equally or differentially expressed in mock-infected and infected cells. Relative mRNA levels of IFNB1, IFIT1, beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), β-actin (ACTB), annexin A1 (ANXA1), and TATA-binding protein (TBP) determined by RT-qPCR reflected the patterns of expression observed in the RNA-seq analyses (Fig. 4C). The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Qiagen) was used to compare the representation of canonical pathways between infected and uninfected cells (Fig. 5A and ​andB)B) and cells infected with either BTV-8wt or BTV8ΔNS4 (Fig. 5C). Most of the pathways were involved in the cellular immune response, cytokine signaling, the inflammatory response, apoptosis, and pathogen-related signaling. Consistent with the RNA-seq data set, pathways relating to the innate immune response were particularly evident when comparing BTV8ΔNS4 with BTV8wt (Fig. 5C)."
921211,5,"The availability of the transcriptome of cells infected by BTV8wt and BTV8ΔNS4 also provided additional information regarding the possible influence of NS4 on mRNA maturation. Comparable proportions of reads containing intron sequences were found in mock-infected cells and in cells infected with BTV8wt or BTV8ΔNS4 (data not shown). In addition, we also quantified how many reads finished with 8 or more adenines, assuming these reads to be representative of polyadenylated mRNAs. Comparable percentages of poly(A) reads were obtained under the three conditions tested, suggesting that NS4 was not associated with a global defect in mRNA polyadenylation (data not shown)."
921211,6,"NS4 modulates the activities of a wide range of promoters. We next assessed the ability of BTV-8 NS4 to reduce the activities of basal promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter and the promoters of genes involved in the host innate immune response (IFN-β and ISRE-containing promoters). 293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing either BTV NS4 or NS2 and an FLuc reporter plasmid driven by either the CMV promoter, the IFN-β promoter, or a promoter containing ISRE elements (Fig. 5). At 4 h posttransfection, cells transfected with the IFN-β promoter were stimulated with Sendai virus, while cells transfected with the ISRE-containing promoter were stimulated with universal IFN (200 U/ml). NS4, unlike NS2, was able to reduce by between 40 and 60% the activities of CMV, IFN-β, and ISRE promoters (Fig. 6)."
921211,7,"To further investigate the ability of NS4 to block host gene expression, sheep cells were cotransfected with an expression plasmid for FLuc, under the control of the CMV immediate-early promoter, along with a variety of expression plasmids expressing BTV NS4 or an empty plasmid (also containing a CMV promoter) as a control (Fig. 7). NS4 is well conserved among the BTV serotypes/strains identified to date (8). The only exceptions were a strain of BTV-1 (GenBank accession number D10905, submitted in 1992) and the more divergent BTV-25 and BTV-26 strains (GenBank accession numbers EU839845 and JN255161), which showed only 77.9%, 76.6%, and 75.3% identity to BTV-8 NS4, respectively (Fig. 7A). All of the NS4 proteins tested were able to reduce FLuc expression, with the notable exception of NS4 from BTV-1 (D10905) (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, the NS4 protein of BTV-1 (D10905) displayed a mobility different from those of other NS4 proteins by SDS-PAGE that could be explained by the presence of considerable differences in the basic residues in the N terminus. In addition, using BTV-8 NS4, we showed that gene expression inhibition by NS4 was dose dependent (Fig. 7C)."
921211,8,"In a previous study, we showed that NS4 localizes in the nucleoli of infected or transfected cells (8). Interestingly, BTV-1 (D10905) NS4 was the only variant that failed to localize to the nucleoli of sheep CPT-Tert cells (Fig. 7D), suggesting that nucleolar localization may be critical for the activity of this nonstructural protein."
921211,9,"NS4 is not the only viral protein involved in host cell protein shutoff. It is well established that BTV induces protein synthesis shutoff in infected cells (64,–66). Conceivably, a reduced level of IFN (both mRNA and proteins) observed in cells infected with BTV8wt could reflect the general virus-induced shutoff of protein synthesis. In order to test this hypothesis, we metabolically radiolabeled nascent proteins in ovEC mock infected or infected with either BTV8wt or BTV8ΔNS4. As expected, we observed decreased levels of 35S-labeled methionine/cysteine proteins in BTV8wt-infected cells compared to mock-infected cells (particularly evident at 18 and 26 h p.i.), confirming previously published data (Fig. 8) (65, 66). Protein synthesis shutoff was also evident in BTV8ΔNS4-infected cells, although at somewhat reduced levels compared to BTV8wt-infected cells. In order to quantify the reduction in protein synthesis during viral infection we used phosphorimaging and measured the signal intensity of a prominent band present in all samples (Fig. 8A, black arrow). The signal intensity of actin in BTV8wt-infected cells relative to mock-infected cells (taken as 100%) decreased progressively to 69% at 10 h p.i., 37% at 18 h p.i., and 2% at 24 h p.i., by which point cytopathic effect was apparent. On the other hand, the signal intensity of actin decreased to 82%, 56%, and 12%. Hence, these data suggest that host protein shutoff induced by BTV occurs largely independently of NS4, although the protein may contribute to the phenomenon."
921211,10,"BTV-8 NS4 does not influence mRNA splicing or translation. We also assessed the impact of NS4 on RNA transcript splicing. CPT-Tert cells were transfected with the pRL-CMV vector, which is driven by the CMV immediate-early promoter and contains the RLuc gene downstream of an intron. In this assay, NS4 retained the ability to inhibit the expression of the reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8B), indicating that NS4 does not affect mRNA splicing and confirming the data obtained by RNA-seq as described above. Cells were also cotransfected with in vitro-transcribed RNA encoding FLuc and an expression plasmid for BTV8 NS4, in order to determine whether NS4-induced inhibition of protein expression could also occur at the translational level (Fig. 8C). Increasing levels of NS4 did not interfere with the level of FLuc activity driven by RNA, as opposed to the activity driven by plasmid DNA, used as a control, suggesting that the inhibition mediated by NS4 most likely occurs at the transcriptional and not at the translational level."
1200121,0,"In the present study, 422 serum samples from sheep (246) and goats (176) were collected and screened for the presence of BTV specific antibodies by c-ELISA. Out of 422 sera tested, 129 (30.6%) (95% CI 26.2–35) were found to be positive for BTV-specific antibodies (Table 1)."
1200121,1,"On the basis of univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, it was concluded that risk factors like sex, and body condition had no significant (P > 0.05) impact (Table 2) whereas species, age, districts and agro-ecology had significant (P < 0.05) influence on the seroprevalence of bluetongue. It was found that goats were 2.3 times more likely to be positive to group specific BT virus antibody than sheep. Adults were three times compared to young animals and animals of lowland compared to highland areas were three times more likely to be seropositive to BTV respectively. Among the districts, small ruminants in Bedelle district were 2.3 times more likely to be seropositive to BTV than Jimma district (Table 2)."
921401,0,"Replication kinetics in vitro and virulence in mice of BTV-2IT2000, BTV-8NET2006, and BTV-8IT2008. In order to investigate virus and host factors affecting the clinical outcome of BTV infection, we initially focused on three different strains of bluetongue: a BTV-2 strain isolated from Italy in 2000 (BTV-2IT2000), a BTV-8 strain isolated from the Netherlands in 2006 (BTV-8NET2006), and a BTV-8 strain isolated in Italy in 2008 (BTV-8IT2008)."
921401,1,"First, we assessed the ability of all viruses to replicate in sheep CPT-Tert cells. No major differences were observed in the replication kinetics of the viruses regardless of the serotype and strain used in the assay (Fig. 1A). We next assessed the virulence of each strain in IFNAR−/− mice, as these mice succumb to wild-type BTV infection (57, 72). Mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 300 PFU of the BTV strains described above. All of the mice inoculated with the various BTV strains showed clinical signs around 3 days p.i., characterized by ocular discharge, apathy, and lethargy. All BTV-infected mice died between 6 and 8 days postinfection, while no signs of disease were observed in the control mock-infected mice (Fig. 1B)."
921401,2,"Influence of species, breed, and age of the mammalian host on the clinical outcome of BTV infection. Several studies investigating the factors that affect the clinical outcome to BTV infection have already been published (1, 20, 21, 73). Here, we aimed to assess the variables affecting the pathogenesis of bluetongue in a single experimental framework. First, we assessed the outcome to BTV infection in 2-year-old goats and sheep of three different breeds (the Northern European Dorset poll, the Italian Sardinian sheep, and a mixed breed from Central Italy). An additional group of Dorset poll sheep, 8 months old in age, were also used in the study. We deliberately used viruses isolated in KC cells and subsequently passaged twice in BHK-21 for all the experimental infections carried out in this study. This strategy allowed us to use viruses minimally passaged in vitro and with the same history in cell culture."
921401,3,"Sheep infected with BTV-8NET2006 developed classic clinical signs of bluetongue, including fever (defined here as body temperature of >40°C), which started 4 to 5 days p.i., depression, anorexia, respiratory distress, increase in salivation, facial edema, and hyperemia of nasal and buccal mucosa (Fig. 2; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material, showing data for each individual animal). Overall, no major differences in clinical signs were observed between the three sheep breeds used in this study or between 8-month-old and 2-year-old Dorset poll sheep. In addition, no significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed in the levels of fever or the cumulative number of days with fever between all the sheep groups. However, one sheep in the mixed-breed infected group had to be euthanized because of onset of severe clinical signs. Consequently, the general and total clinical score of the infected mixed-breed group was higher than that of the other groups (Fig. 2A). In all the infected groups, BTV RNA in the blood peaked at about 5 days p.i. and then slowly decreased, although it remained detectable up to 4 weeks p.i., at which point the experiment was concluded (Fig. 2C; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Neutralizing antibodies were detected at day 7 p.i., peaked by day 14 p.i., and then remained essentially constant for the duration of the experiment (Fig. 2D)."
921401,4,"On the other hand, goats after BTV-8NET2006 infection showed no clinical signs or fever throughout the duration of the experiment (28 days) (Fig. 2A and ​andB).B). Differences in the body temperature between day 3 and 10 postinfection were statistically significant between goats and each of the groups of sheep described above (P < 0.0001). The onset of viremia in goats was delayed compared to that in infected sheep, peaking at 10 days postinfection. Average levels of BTV RNA in the blood were at least 10-fold higher in goats than in infected sheep between day 9 and 16 p.i., but overall the differences observed were not statistically significant due to individual variations (ANOVA P = 0.45) (Fig. 2C; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). All mock-infected sheep and goat controls used in this study showed no clinical signs and remained negative for the presence of both viral RNA in the blood and neutralizing antibodies toward BTV (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material)."
921401,5,"Influence of BTV strain and serotype on the clinical outcome of BTV infection. We also assessed the pathogenicity of different BTV serotypes, as well as different virus strains within a single serotype. The severity of disease observed in sheep inoculated with either BTV-2IT2000 or BTV-8NET2006 was largely equivalent, with both viruses inducing typical clinical signs observed in bluetongue (Fig. 3A). In contrast, animals infected with BTV-8IT2008 showed only a mild transitory fever but no other clinical signs (Fig. 3B; see also Fig. S3 in the supplemental material showing data for each individual animal). Excluding the temporary pyrexia displayed by some animals at day 1 p.i., BTV-8NET2006 and BTV-2IT2000 induced cumulatively 17 and 18 days of fever in their respective groups of infected sheep. In contrast, BTV-8IT2008 induced only 8 cumulative days of fever. Overall, we also observed that on average sheep infected with BTV-8NET2006 or BTV-2IT2000 displayed higher levels of fever than sheep infected with BTV-8IT2008, although differences were not statistically significant (ANOVA P = 0.17). BTV-8IT2008, BTV-8NET2006, and BTV-2IT2000 all induced similar levels of viremia (ANOVA P = 0.54) and neutralizing antibodies in infected sheep (Fig. 3C and ​and D)."
921401,6,"We next sequenced the complete genomes of BTV-8NET2006 and BTV-8IT2008 in order to determine the genetic basis for the different phenotypes of these two viruses. We detected a total of 24 nucleotide mutations between BTV-8NET2006 and BTV-8IT2008, including 16 silent mutations and 8 nonsynonymous mutations, leading to differences in the viral VP1, VP2, VP4, NS1, NS2, and VP6 proteins (Fig. 4)."
921401,7,"Effect of cell culture adaptation on BTV virulence. Published reports suggest that, in some cases, infection of target species using blood directly from a naturally BTV-infected animal induces more severe clinical signs than tissue culture-adapted virus (20, 61). In the context of the experimental framework used in this study, we inoculated two groups of Sardinian sheep with either blood from a BTV-infected animal [BTV-8NET2007(blood)] or the same virus isolated in cell culture after a single passage in KC cells and two passages in BHK21 [BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK)]. As assessed by qRT-PCR, the infected blood contained approximately 100-fold less viral RNA than the inoculum of BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK) (data not shown). Sheep infected with BTV-8NET2007(blood) displayed a higher clinical score and reached statistically significant higher levels of fever (P = 0.01) than sheep inoculated with BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK) (Fig. 5A and ​andB;B; see also Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). Sheep infected with BTV-8NET2007(blood) displayed 27 cumulative days of fever as opposed to 16 shown by sheep infected with BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK). In addition, the levels of viral RNA in the blood were also consistently and considerably higher (10- to 1,000-fold; P = 0.018) in sheep infected with BTV-8NET2007(blood) than those found in BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK)-infected sheep (Fig. 5C; see also Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). Interestingly, viremia was delayed by 2 days in BTV-8NET2007(blood)-infected animals. In addition, we did not find neutralizing antibodies at 7 days postinfection in any of the sheep infected with BTV-8NET2007(blood) (Fig. 5D). In contrast, all sheep infected with BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK) had BTV-neutralizing antibodies by day 7 p.i. No differences in the levels of neutralizing antibodies were found at later time points between sheep infected with BTV-8NET2007(blood) and BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK). Thus, as proposed in other studies (20, 61), infection of sheep with BTV collected directly from infected animals and never passaged in tissue culture induced more severe clinical signs than the homologous virus passaged even minimally in tissue culture."
921401,8,"BTV population diversity influences virulence. Next, we aimed to link the phenotypic differences described above between sheep inoculated with BTV-8NET2007(blood) and BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK) to genetic changes that might occur in the virus following cell culture adaptation. We analyzed the genomes of BTV-8NET2007(blood) and BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK) by deep sequencing, using the same stocks utilized in the experimental infections described above. We also analyzed the intermediate viruses BTV-8NET2007(1KC) and BTV-8NET2007(1KC-1BHK). Furthermore, in order to test the reproducibility of the results obtained, we repeated in parallel the adaptation in KC and BHK21 cells of BTV-8NET2007(blood) in an independent set of experiments. All together, we analyzed the full genome of 7 viral samples: BTV-8NET2007(blood) and two independent isolates of BTV-8NET2007(1KC), BTV-8NET2007(1KC-1BHK), and BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK)."
921401,9,"We found that the consensus sequences of BTV-8NET2007(blood) and BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK) were identical, with the exception of two silent mutations in segments 1 (nucleotide 2756) and segment 4 (nucleotide 1431) (Fig. 6). Both point mutations were selected after the initial passage in KC cells and in both independent experiments."
921401,10,"RNA viruses, due to their high mutation rates, do not exist as a single genotype but as a complex of variants (also referred to as quasispecies), each possessing unique random mutations (74, 75). Consequently, we analyzed BTV-8NET2007(blood) and the effect on its population diversity after passaging in vitro in KC and BHK21 cells."
921401,11,"In Fig. 7, we have plotted the degree of variability at each nucleotide position of each genomic segment before and after passaging in cell culture. A nucleotide is plotted and is referred to as a “variant” if it represents at least 0.1% of the viral population. In general, the number of variants was higher in the virus before cell passaging, or after one passage in KC cells, than what observed even after a single passage in BHK21 cells. Interestingly, for 9 of the 10 segments in the first set of experiments, and for 8 of the 10 segments in the second set of experiments, the number of variable nucleotides was higher in the virus passaged once in KC cells than in the virus from blood before passage in cell culture. There was a larger number of variants with a frequency between 0.1 and 0.29% in BTV-8NET2007(1KC), while the number of variants with a frequency of >0.4% was severalfold higher in BTV-8NET2007(blood) (Fig. 8). The two silent mutations selected in the consensus sequence of BTV-8NET2007(1KC-2BHK) were already present as high-prevalence variants in BTV-8NET2007(blood) (14.9% for nucleotide 2756 of segment 1 and 10.4% for nucleotide 1431 of segment 4) (dots circled in red in Fig. 7). On the other hand, other variants present with a frequency of about 10% in segment 3 and segment 6 were not selected after passage in vitro. Essentially, the same results were obtained in the two independent sets of experiments."
2299383,0,"Bluetongue virus and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus sero-prevalence and sero-incidence. The results generated by c-ELISA for the 137 cattle samples showed that the small per-farm sample size (12; IQR: 10–21) resulted in a large between-farm variation in the BTV and EHDV sero-prevalence (Table 1). The highest BTV and EHDV sero-prevalence was recorded for samples collected during the 2000/2001 season. However, there was only a significant difference recorded between the sero-prevalence of antibodies to EHDV in cattle over the three seasons (p = 0.043). The median sero-prevalence of BTV and EHDV in the cattle sampled across the three rainy seasons studied was 62% (IQR: 30–89) and 56% (IQR: 5–77), respectively."
2299383,1,"The results from the 72 sheep also showed that the small per-farm sample size (12; IQR: 11–13) resulted in a large between-farm variation in the BTV and EHDV sero-prevalence (Table 2). The sero-prevalence of BTV antibodies in sheep was highest in the third season (2001/2002), but the difference between years was not significant (p = 0.513). The median sero-prevalence of BTV and EHDV over the three seasons was 41% (IQR: 19–63) and 0% (IQR: 0–21), respectively."
2299383,2,"The nine sentinel cattle herds, established over the three rainy seasons, comprised a total of 65 cattle with a median of 9 (IQR: 5–14) cattle per farm (Table 3). The small sentinel herd sample size resulted in a large between-sentinel herd variation in the sero-incidence of BTV and EHDV. Median sero-incidences for BTV and EHDV in cattle of 43% (IQR: 22–67) and 27% (IQR: 9–57), respectively, were recorded."
2299383,3,"The six sentinel sheep herds, established over the three rainy seasons, comprised a total of 44 sheep, with a median of 9 (IQR: 7–11) sheep per farm. Only one sheep seroconverted against EHDV and seven sheep converted against BTV across all three seasons. The median sero-incidence of BTV over the three seasons was 14% (IQR: 6–23)."
2299383,4,"Viral serotyping. Virus isolations were made from three individual cows from two of the farms where the sentinel cattle were located during the 2001/2002 season. The virus type, determined by neutralisation assays for each isolate, was BTV serotype 3. No EHDV isolations were made."
2549955,0,"Two BTV-1 clinical cases occurred in November 2007 in France. As in the BTV-8 study, we did not include these two first cases because they could induce bias in the estimation of the velocity of BTV-1 spread. These two cases occurred at the end of the vector activity period and were followed by the vector-free period during which BTV transmission was effectively inactive. In 2008, 4,195 BTV-1 clinical cases were reported. From this, we identified the date of the first clinical case in 1,595 municipalities (Fig. 1). These dates ranged from July 11th 2008 to January 5th 2009."
2549955,1,"1 Velocity of BTV-1 spread estimation. We selected the smallest subset of fourth-order TSA-SARerr models for which the sum of the AICc weights was ≥0.9. The resulting subset contained 66 models (Table S2). Model-averaged parameters obtained from these 66 models were used to estimate a velocity for each of the 1,595 municipalities. These velocity estimates ranged from 0.98 to 126.34 km/day with a mean value of 5.35 km/day (median value  = 2.64 km/day). However, 90% (1,439) of the municipalities had velocity ≤10 km/day, indicating that BTV-1 spread was mostly local. High values for the velocity of BTV-1 spread were marginal, potentially linked with farm animal movements. Model residuals, i.e., the difference between the fitted and observed date of first clinical case, had a mean non-significantly different from zero (0.2, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): −0.43−0.93) and a bell-shaped distribution. No spatial structure was detected in these residuals. The difference between the fitted and observed date of first clinical case was less than 16 days for 1,337 municipalities (84%) and environmental covariates were available for 1,314 of these municipalities (82%). For this sub-dataset of 1,314 municipalities the minimum and maximum velocities were identical to those of the full dataset, and the mean and median values of the velocity of BTV-1 spread were 5.72 and 2.74 km/day, respectively. The estimated velocities at these 1,314 municipalities were subsequently included in the analysis of the effect of vaccination (see section 3.2). Velocity vectors of the 1,314 municipalities are presented in Figure 2: from the initial introduction zone (indicated by a red arrow on the map), the virus spread rapidly from west to east along the Pyrenees Mountains, then, from this initial incursion, the virus spread sideways to the south and north. The departments with few infected municipalities, in red on the map, were departments with an early vaccination scheme."
2549955,2,"2 Effect of vaccination on velocity of BTV-1 spread. Figure 3 displays vaccine coverage for the 1,314 municipalities used to analyse the effect of vaccination. Of these municipalities, 78% (1,028) had no vaccine coverage at the date of first clinical case. For the 286 municipalities with vaccine coverage, the percentage of immunized animals ranged from 0.4% to 100% (n = 15 municipalities) with a median value of 55%. The 1,314 municipality data subset was split randomly into “training” (986 municipalities) and “testing” subsets (328 municipalities). The first was used to fit linear regression models via OLS (Table S3). The best OLS model included elevation, edge density between arable land and forest, temperature at one and two month lags, rainfall at a two month lag, small ruminant and beef cattle densities, and vaccination coverage. This OLS model performed poorly in predicting the velocity of BTV-1 spread from environmental covariates (squared Pearson's r = 0.27, RMSE  = 7.33 km/day) in the training dataset and spatial autocorrelation at short distance was detected in the residuals (Fig. S2A). We thus fitted a RAC model to account for spatial autocorrelation. The RAC model contained the environmental covariates from the above OLS model plus an autocovariate that represented spatial autocorrelation in the residuals of the OLS model at a neighborhood size of 3.6 km. The fit of the RAC model was satisfactory (squared Pearson's r = 0.81, RMSE  = 3.69 km/day). In contrast to the OLS model, analysis of the residuals showed no spatial autocorrelation (Fig. S2). Parameter estimates of the RAC model are presented in Table 2. The RAC model was tested on the 328 municipality testing dataset and predictive performance was good (squared Pearson's r = 0.86, RMSE  = 3.14 km/day)."
2549955,3,"Estimated coefficients and p-values of environmental covariates are reported in Table 2. The intercept indicates an average velocity of BTV-1 spread of approximately 3.5 km/day (Table 2). As expected, vaccination was negatively associated with velocity of BTV-1 spread, which was, on average, 1.7 km/day lower in municipalities with immunized animals at the date of first clinical case, than in municipalities with no immunized animals."
2549955,4,"Meteorological variables, landscape factors and host availability were also correlated to velocity of BTV-1 spread. The contribution of covariates to model fit was assessed via D-values of each covariate (Fig. S3). Weather at a two-month lag had the greatest effect on the velocity of BTV-1 spread, followed by edge density between arable land and forest, temperature at one-month lag and density of beef cattle. Weather at a two-month lag greatly influenced velocity, the latter being negatively correlated to the monthly average of maximum daily temperature such that a 4 km/day decrease in velocity was observed when monthly average of maximum daily temperature was higher than 25°C. Velocity was also positively associated with rainfall: heavy rainfall (>70 mm per month) increased the velocity by 4 km/day. Considering the effect of weather at a one-month lag, a monthly average of maximum daily temperature around 24°C was associated with a velocity increase of 1.9 km/day. Overall, the effect of weather on the velocity of BTV-1 spread was greater at a two-month lag than at a one-month lag. Regarding landscape-related variables, elevation and edge density between arable land and forest were positively correlated with velocity. Finally, velocity of BTV-1 spread was associated with beef cattle and small ruminant densities in different ways, while the density of dairy cattle had negligible effect. Velocity was positively associated with beef cattle density. On the other hand, the highest small ruminant densities (>20 small ruminants/km2) were negatively correlated with velocity."
2549955,5,"Finally, the range of velocities obtained by varying a single covariate across its observed range whilst holding all other covariates constant at their observed mean is presented in Figure 4. The graph provides a visual indication of the independent effect-size of each covariate on the average value of 3.5 km/day."
341358,0,"Between 2012 and 2013, at the national level, 37 of 171 dairy cattle herds (21.6, 95% confidence interval: 16.1–28.4%) analyzed and 85 of 466 dairy cattle heads (18.2, 95% confidence interval: 15.0–22.0%) analyzed showed antibodies against BTV using cELISA as shown in Table 1. The agreement of the serologic status between dairy cattle sampled within the same herd in our prevalence study, as measured by the intra-class correlation coefficient, was 0.21. Our results identified the population sizes of herds to be a protective factor. An increased number of animals inside the farm led to a decreased risk of being positive. In the univariable analysis (Table 2), no significant risk differences in land use, adult/calf ratios, and experience of reproductive problems were found. Our results identified herd size as a protective factor. An increased number of animals inside the farm led to risk of being positive (OR = 2.762, p = 0.003 in a herd of ≤5 animals; OR = 4.174, p = < 0.001 in a herd of 6–30), while older age was shown to be a significant risk factor (OR = 0.294, p = < 0.001 in juveniles; OR = 0.443, p = 0.004 in a herd of subadults). The cattle density for the class of 11–20 animals was another significant risk factor (OR = 1.737, p = 0.070), while cattle densities for the classes of ≤10 or ≥ 21 were not significantly associated. We observed a significant difference in the individual likelihood of being positive in southern provinces with respect to northern provinces (OR = 1.757, p = 0.019). A significant difference was also observed in the individual likelihood of being positive in western provinces with respect to eastern provinces (OR = 0.531, p = 0.026). The risk factors identified in the multivariable logistic model (p < 0.001) were as follows: older animals (adults), southern, and northern provinces. The herd size was confirmed to be a protective factor (Table 3). Of the positive dairy cattle herds, 82.4% (28/34) were clustered in either < 30% or > 81%, suggesting a bimodal frequency distribution (Fig. 2). Additionally, there were substantial regional differences in the seroprevalence within South Korea (Fig. 1). Of the 85 ELISA-positive samples, only 59 were positive by SNT (Table 1) and neutralized one or more BTV serotypes: 1 (26 serum samples), 2 (11 serum samples), 3 (15 serum samples), 4 (13 serum samples), 7 (6 serum samples), 15 (9 serum samples), and 16 (13 serum samples). These findings support the notion that BTV-1 is the most prevalent serotype in South Korea. By contrast, 26 dairy cattle serum samples failed to neutralize any known BTV serotype. Additionally, the RNA of the BTV-1, − 2, − 3, − 15, and − 16 serotypes was detected in 13 serologically positive blood samples by RT-PCR, indicating that several BTV serotypes were actively circulating in the dairy cattle populations in the studied area. Further phylogenetic analysis and virus isolation for these blood samples could not be performed using these samples because of an insufficient blood volume and quality of the positive samples."
