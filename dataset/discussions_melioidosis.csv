822569,0,"Here, we summarized the reported cases of melioidosis in South Korea. A total of 11 cases of melioidosis were reported during the past 12 years, and the overall fatality rate was 36.4%. All the patients had visited Southeast Asia, where melioidosis is endemic. Most of the cases stayed in the endemic area for months to years, and developed symptoms before returning to South Korea or within a few months after the return. However, some cases stayed in the endemic region for as little as a few days, and one case developed symptoms 3 years after returning to South Korea. Pneumonia was the most frequent clinical manifestation, but the patients showed a wide spectrum of clinical features, including a mycotic aneurysm of the aorta and coinfection with tuberculosis. An early diagnosis and initiation of the appropriate antibiotics can reduce mortality. Consequently, increased awareness of the risk factors and clinical features of melioidosis is required."
822569,1,"Most melioidosis cases result from recent exposure, as the majority of melioidosis cases in the endemic region occur during the rainy season. The incubation period of melioidosis ranges from days to months [10]. A previous study calculated an incubation period of 1–21 days between the inoculating event and symptom onset [11]. However, B. pseudomallei can reactivate after an initial asymptomatic infection with extremely prolonged latency. There are reports of melioidosis becoming symptomatic more than 20 years after the suspected exposure 12, 13. In this report, incubation periods could not be determined clearly, as most of the patients failed to recall the actual event of inhalation or inoculation. Therefore, the time period between returning to South Korea and the onset of symptoms was recorded as an indirect measure of the minimum incubation period. More than half of the cases developed symptoms during their stay in the endemic region or within 1 month after returning to South Korea. However, the initial symptoms developed more than 1 month after returning to South Korea in five cases, and the interval between return and symptom manifestation was as long as 3 years in one case [4]. Although poorly understood, the prolonged latency of B. pseudomallei is thought to be associated with its facultative anaerobic nature, ability to persist without nutrients, and ability to endure antibiotic pressure by assuming filamentous forms [14]. It is important that physicians should not rule out melioidosis simply because the duration from the suspected exposure to symptom onset is longer than a month."
822569,2,"Risk factors for melioidosis include diabetes mellitus, heavy alcohol consumption, chronic lung disease, chronic renal disease, malignancy, and immunosuppressive treatment [3]. Patients with these risk factors are predisposed to melioidosis, and previous studies showed that 80–87% of melioidosis patients had at least one risk factor 3, 15, 16. Of the risk factors, diabetes mellitus is most important. Diabetes has been reported in 38–60% of melioidosis patients 17, 18, 19, 20, and the calculated risk of melioidosis in diabetics is as high as 21.2 (95% confidence interval 17.1–26.3) times the risk in nondiabetics [16]. The presence of risk factors is associated not only with susceptibility to the disease, but also with its severity and clinical manifestations. The chronic form of melioidosis was less common in diabetic patients and more commonly observed in patients without risk factors. In addition, patients without risk factors tended to have lower rates of bacteremia, septic shock, and mortality [3]. In the present series, seven (64%) patients had at least one risk factor, all of whom were diabetic. Of the four patients without risk factors, chronic infection was observed in three (75%) and two (50%) had bacteremia. By contrast, none of the seven patients with at least one risk factor developed a chronic infection and all of them were bacteremic."
822569,3,"Previous reports showed that male sex is an independent risk factor for melioidosis 16, 21. High occupational exposure to soil and water is a significant risk factor for melioidosis [22], and the association between male sex and melioidosis is suggested to reflect an increased exposure to B. pseudomallei [16]. In the present series, all the cases were male, and this may also be associated with high environmental exposure. Cases with higher occupational exposure to soil and a prolonged duration of stay in an endemic area have a higher chance of exposure to B. pseudomallei. Under the current social circumstances of South Korea, men are more likely to work in foreign countries for a long period, and this may explain the reason that all the patients are male. In fact, only three cases in the present series were tourists, and the remaining eight cases were those who stayed in Southeast Asia for occupational purpose for months to years."
822569,4,"The fatality rate of melioidosis ranges from 14% to 49% 3, 17, 18 and was reported to be as high as 65% in bacteremic patients [19]. Old age (≥50 years), the presence of risk factors (diabetes, heavy alcohol use, and chronic lung or renal disease), and markers of organ dysfunction (leukopenia; raised liver enzyme, urea, and creatinine levels; and acidosis) on admission are thought to be associated with mortality 3, 23, 24. In the present series, four patients, three with diabetes and one elderly patient, died from melioidosis. Two patients had septic shock with evidence of organ dysfunction on admission. The overall fatality rate was 36.4%. Despite its considerable fatality rate, a recent study suggested that survival is improving. In the Darwin study, the fatality rate from melioidosis decreased from 30% to 9% over the past 20 years, and this was attributed to an early diagnosis, early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics (ceftazidime or meropenem), and access to intensive care management [3]. Similarly, the mortality of melioidosis in South Korea may be reduced by an early diagnosis and initiation of the proper antibiotics. Empirical antibiotic treatment often does not cover B. pseudomallei, so an early suspicion of melioidosis is essential."
822569,5,"Pneumonia is the most common presenting feature of melioidosis, followed by genitourinary infection and soft tissue infection 1, 3. Similarly, in this study, seven (63.6%) patients presented with pneumonia, three (27.3%) patients presented with genitourinary infection, and one (9.1%) patient presented with soft tissue infection. Abscesses were found in the prostate, spleen, and liver, which are well-recognized sites of abscess formation [3]. A mycotic aneurysm of the aorta was observed in Case 5. Although very uncommon, mycotic aneurysms due to melioidosis have been reported, and are thought to be associated with high mortality and relapse rates [25]. Therefore, melioidosis should be suspected when patients with risk factors for melioidosis present with a mycotic aneurysm. Moreover, although pain is seen in the majority of patients, the presenting symptoms of a mycotic aneurysm are often nonspecific [25]. The patient in Case 5 denied any pain on admission, and the mycotic aneurysm was detected incidentally in the process of evaluation of the fever focus. Therefore, a mycotic aneurysm should be included in the sites for further evaluation in melioidosis patients whose primary infection focus is obscure."
822569,6,"Case 1 had a coinfection with pulmonary tuberculosis and melioidosis. The patient was initially diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, but showed a poor response to antitubercular treatment and was finally diagnosed with melioidosis. Melioidosis might manifest as a chronic pulmonary infection that mimics pulmonary tuberculosis and could be misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, especially in areas endemic for tuberculosis, but not for melioidosis [26]. Moreover, as in this case, a coinfection of melioidosis and pulmonary tuberculosis can occur [27], leading to considerable confusion in the treatment process. Although not well established, previous case reports suggested that mycobacterial infection is a risk factor for melioidosis, reflecting host susceptibility to intracellular pathogens [1]. The patient of Case 1 might have had underlying pulmonary tuberculosis, and this might have acted as a risk factor for melioidosis. Increased suspicion for melioidosis is required when patients with a history of visiting endemic regions present with chronic pneumonia."
822569,7,"In summary, we presented the detailed epidemiological and clinical features of the reported cases of melioidosis from 2003 to 2014."
435540,0,"Few models have been used to predict the incidence of melioidosis on either a national or global scale [14, 15, 43]. We applied population dynamics, seasonal movement, and the impact of diabetes to study melioidosis epidemiology in Thailand. Other approaches such as decision tree or Markov model can also be used to study melioidosis epidemiology given that the rate of transmission is constant and the system is linear. Our model fits a dynamic model for a non-transmissible disease to data on notifications only, which should allow reasonable predictions to be made as to the future course of the epidemic. However, drawing strong inferences regarding parameter values that pertain to transitions through infection/disease states after the point of infection is less safe, such that particular caution should be exercised in regards to parameters, especially those discussed here. Our findings have some similarities and differences compared with previously published work. Limmathurotsakul and colleagues used a negative binomial model to derive estimates of 7,572 (3,396–17,685) cases for global melioidosis incidence in the year 2015 [15]. This figure was similar to the incidence of melioidosis estimated in our study, which was 7,569 cases (4,834–8,701) for 2015. Both studies reached similar estimates of approximately 50% for case reporting and 40–45% for mortality/death rate for melioidosis (see S2 Table A), while the risk factors identified for melioidosis were also in agreement, i.e. being male, aged more than 44 years old, and having diabetes [13]. Two previous studies by both Thai and Australian researchers consistently showed that type 2 diabetes increased the risk of melioidosis by more than 10 times when compared with those non-diabetes [13, 44], this figure is similar to our model estimates. Buckee and colleagues pointed out that seasonal disease incidence could be driven by the mobility and aggregation of human populations, which spark outbreaks and sustain transmission [30]. Northeast and transient males aged more than 45 years old were also predicted by our model to be a highest risk groups for melioidosis. Apart from reporting and mortality/death rates for melioidosis, the model also gave the estimates for some natural history of disease parameters which would be hard to measure i.e. proportion and duration of asymptomatic infections, duration of untreated symptomatic infections, and host susceptibility to melioidosis [45]. With regard to asymptomatic infections, a few studies have tried to characterize and estimate the number of these hidden infections [44–46]. Our model suggested that there could be a significant proportion of asymptomatic infections (54%). Although the parameter values used in the fitting and prediction process are based on annual incidence data only, the variation in the parameter values is included to reflect the uncertainty in the predictions, and the posterior distributions represent sets of collinear parameters that reproduce the observed data. Further studies and more appropriate data are required to refine these parameters."
435540,1,"Our model can provide many benefits for health policy planning. First, the model, in common with previous studies, estimated that only about half of all melioidosis cases were being reported. Under-reporting results in melioidosis being neglected, even more than other neglected diseases such as dengue and leptospirosis [16]. Previous study suggested that melioidosis was the third most frequent cause of death from infectious diseases in northeast Thailand, after HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis [13]. By regarding melioidosis as being less important disease has made it being further under-recognized by healthcare professionals, low health budgets to invest in intensive prevention and control, poor disease knowledge and practices among the population at risk, and finally a lack of research that would enable the development of concrete strategies to improve standards of care. Second, the model can be used to guide the design of targeted interventions i.e. predicting and identifying populations at high risk for morbidity and mortality. In line with the model’s predictions, targeted intervention strategies could be concentrated among the male population of working age who live in the Northeast, as well as the transient population. These strategies could include providing health education to increase protective practices while engaging in agricultural activities, washing after work, and seeking appropriate health advice when feeling sick. To prevent deaths due to infections in older age groups, i.e. 45 years or older (65%) (see S2 Table A), national strategies could focus on early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, as well as improving diabetes screening programmes, since elderly people with diabetes may be prone to severe melioidosis."
435540,2,"Our model has some limitations. For simplicity we assumed that diabetes influenced the likelihood of melioidosis infection alone and therefore once the person is infected with melioidosis, the diagnosis and disease progression are independent of diabetes status. Although diabetes has been shown to play roles in increasing severity and/or that medication of diabetes may also affect susceptibility and presentation of melioidosis [47, 48]. We also assumed that mortality/death rates for melioidosis, incidence rates of diabetes, and seasonal movement rates were constant over time, although they varied by age. It has been suggested that mortality/death rate for melioidosis due to diabetes have decreased over time because of improved access to hospitals [49], and lifestyle changes might also have affected incidence rates [50]. In this model we classified the population into those living in the Northeast and non-Northeast, which meant that the model was unable to predict the incidence of melioidosis in locations more specifically than non-Northeast. It is important to keep in mind that melioidosis is probably prevalent in all regions of Thailand, the lack of knowledge, disease awareness and diagnosis tools led to heavily report of cases by the Northeast region only [16]. We assumed that the estimates of reporting among both males and females were the same. The annual epidemiological surveillance reports of melioidosis data used in the model included cases from all provinces around Thailand, except for those cases seen in private hospitals, which account for about 30% of hospital provision, although there is no information on the relative likelihood of melioidosis being diagnosed in different sectors. Melioidosis diagnoses reported annually by the BoE are made using an indirect hemagglutination (IHA) technique to test for antibodies to B. pseudomallei, which has been found to have low sensitivity and specificity. It could therefore potentially under-predict the number of cases."
435540,3,"Conclusion. Population dynamics, seasonal movement, melioidosis infection rates, and under-reporting are important components of melioidosis incidence patterns. The increases seen in melioidosis cases are partly attributable to demographic changes as working, transient, and aging population groups are more prone to develop melioidosis. The key findings from our study are firstly, the increasing trend of melioidosis incidence, especially among males aged 45–59 years old, is predicted to continue; and secondly, the male, Northeast, and transient populations aged 45–59 years old were at the highest risk of melioidosis infection."
435540,4,"We anticipate that the modelling methods described here could be used in similar settings, especially those with reliable census data, to estimate the future melioidosis burden, as well as the potential effects of under-reporting. In addition, this modelling approach could be adapted to study other infectious diseases, behavioral changes, and seasonal movements, where demographic factors are important drivers of a population’s disease burden."
2515873,0,"There were 4632 genes differentially expressed in melioidosis and 5045 genes in tuberculosis, thus approximately 20% of the human genome is differentially regulated in each disease. The most prominent pathway in melioidosis was interferon (IFN)-γ and the same was true of tuberculosis. There were no pathways differentially regulated in melioidosis that were not also differentially regulated in tuberculosis, and there was no signature which reliably distinguished melioidosis and tuberculosis."
2515873,1,"Berry et al. identified an 86-gene signature as being specific for tuberculosis after eliminating differentially regulated genes common to Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus infections, and to two auto-inflammatory diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus and Still’s disease). This signature was also present in melioidosis, which is surprising given that all melioidosis patients recruited had acute rather than chronic melioidosis, which is clinically distinct from tuberculosis."
2515873,2,"Interferon-mediated Responses. The IFN-γ pathway was reported as the most prominent pathway identified in gene expression studies of a mouse model of melioidosis [27], and blocking IFN-γ dramatically increases host susceptibility to melioidosis [3]. In human studies, plasma IFN-γ concentrations were high in melioidosis [3], and IFN-γ-mediated responses were also the most prominent feature in a gene expression study of melioidosis in another human cohort [28]. The finding here that this feature is shared with tuberculosis is unsurprising, because IFN-γ responses are crucial for the host response against intracellular pathogens such as B. pseudomallei and M. tuberculosis. IFN-γ treatment has a role in the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and adjunctive therapy with IFN-γ is beneficial in a mouse model of melioidosis [29], although its role in clinical melioidosis remains undefined [30]."
2515873,3,"In their original report on this tuberculosis cohort, Berry et al. noted that type 2 IFN-γ responses were prominent, but noted that type 1 IFN-αβ responses were present also [7]. We found that type 1 interferon-αβ responses were just as prominent in melioidosis, but the clinical relevance of this remains to be defined."
2515873,4,"Type 1 interferons can be produced by almost any cell type (leukocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells) and are induced by a range of bacterial pathogens, whereupon they proceed to modulate the host response in a manner that is as yet incompletely understood [31]. The signalling pathways initiated by type 1 interferons are best described in terms of their activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members (STAT1 to STAT6) [32], the best studied of which are STAT1 and STAT3. STAT1 activation is dependent on both type 1 and type 2 interferons and results in a pro-inflammatory response, with recruitment of inflammatory cells and the enhancement of antigen presentation [31]. On the other hand, STAT3 activation is a key mediator of IL-10 signalling, and results in inhibition of inflammatory responses and directly inhibits STAT1 activation [31]. The role of STAT4 is less well described, but STAT4 activation may play a role in T helper 1 lymphocyte differentiation, which is an essential part of the host response to intracellular pathogens. Type 1 interferons are also necessary for the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase [33], which is in turn necessary for the clearance of intracellular bacteria. Interestingly, type 1 interferons are able to inhibit IL-1β production and inflammasome assembly by two separate mechanisms: the first is via inhibition of NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in a STAT1-dependent manner; the second, is a reduction in pro-IL-1 levels via a STAT3-dependent pathway [34]. It has previously be shown that host response to B. pseudomallei is inflammasome-dependent [35]."
2515873,5,"The role of type 1 interferons in tuberculosis is unclear, since mice deficient in the production of type 1 interferons are better able to control M. tuberculosis infections [36], but type 1 interferons also play a non-redundant protective role in the absence of type 2 interferon signaling [37]. The role of type 1 interferons in the pathogenesis of melioidosis remains to be studied."
2515873,6,"PAMP-specific Responses. TLR4 and CD14 are upregulated in both melioidosis and tuberculosis. The classical ligand for TLR4 [38] and for CD14 [39] is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which would explain this finding for B. pseudomallei. TLR4 will recognize heparin-binding haemagglutinin [40], and CD14 will bind lipoarabinomannan [41], both of which are expressed by M. tuberculosis."
2515873,7,"The pattern recognition receptors TLR5 [25] and NLRC4 [26] both recognize flagellin. No alternative ligand has yet been described for TLR5, so it is more difficult to explain why tuberculosis should apparently induce a flagellin-response. One explanation is that upregulation of pattern recognition receptors is not driven by their ligands. TLR5 expression is induced as part of the type 1 interferon response [42], while NLRC4 is upregulated as part of the TNF-α response [43]. Both pathways are prominent in the host response to melioidosis. In support of this hypothesis, the TLRs are upregulated as a group in both melioidosis (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR8 and TLR10) and tuberculosis (TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8)."
2515873,8,"Limitations and Future Research. Tuberculosis is strongly associated with HIV infection, but melioidosis is not. HIV targets primarily CD4-positive T-lymphocytes and lymphocyte depletion is a feature of all sepsis. Lymphocytes were depleted in both the melioidosis and the TB cohorts, so lymphocyte-related pathways and modules are missing from the whole blood gene expression data of both cohorts, making it difficult to make any comment about the relative role of CD4-positive cells in melioidosis compared to tuberculosis. The whole blood signature was dominated by neutrophils which may also have obscured any lymphocyte signature. Future studies that use purified lymphocytes harvested from melioidosis patients may shed light on this issue."
2515873,9,"Microarrays generate large amounts of data that are useful for the development of hypotheses. Our analysis has identified a number of other pathways that are differentially regulated in melioidosis, but which are unstudied to date. Notably, the TRAIL pathway is differentially regulated in melioidosis, but its role remains undefined at present. The glypicans (cell surface proteoglycans) contribute to cell proliferation and growth, both essential processes in the host response to infection. To date, investigations into the role of glypicans have been confined primarily to cancer biology, although glypican-deficient mice are more susceptibility to respiratory infections [44]. In tuberculosis, the glypican network appears to have greater prominence than even the interferon-mediated responses."
2515873,10,"Conclusions. Host responses to melioidosis and TB are dominated by interferon-signalling events, despite the fact that the organisms are unrelated and present completely different cell-surface PAMPs to the host. This is likely because they both stimulate host responses common to intracellular pathogens, and because the expression of pattern recognition receptors is not driven by their ligands, but by cytokine responses (primarily IFN-γ and TNF-α). The 86-gene signature identified by Berry et al. clusters melioidosis patients just as effectively as it clusters tuberculosis. It therefore seems likely that whole blood gene signatures will not be able to diagnose tuberculosis in areas where melioidosis and TB are co-endemic, but may find utility when interpreted in combination with clinical features. Further studies using direct comparisons will be required to confirm this finding."
1477397,0,"Our data suggest that melioidosis is the third most common cause of death from an infectious disease in our region after HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Deaths from melioidosis and tuberculosis were comparable in 2006, and melioidosis may become established as the second most common cause of death if the current trend of increasing melioidosis incidence is sustained. The population mortality rate for melioidosis is more than from malaria and diarrheal illness combined in this setting, diseases that are usually considered to be of high priority by funding agencies and global health organizations. We propose that the number of cases and deaths from melioidosis reported here represents a minimum estimate, because we have not accounted for patients presenting to community hospitals in the province who were not referred to Sappasithiprasong Hospital. There are several reasons for the lack of referral, including patients with mild disease and those who were seriously ill and died shortly after admission to a community hospital or during inter-hospital transfer. Diagnostic microbiology is not available in these hospitals, and it is also possible that the diagnosis could be missed. Melioidosis can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, and our study shows that active use of diagnostic microbiology can improve case detection. It is also likely that melioidosis is underreported as a cause of death in the National Statistics; laboratory isolation and identification of B. pseudomallei may take up to 1 week, and one-half of deaths because of melioidosis occur in the first 48 hours after presentation to hospital when the true diagnosis may be unknown and not listed on the death certificate."
1477397,1,"The death rate from melioidosis showed a modest decline during the study period and is currently around 40%. This improvement was not associated with changes in recommended antimicrobial regimens over the study period. Ceftazidime has been the recommended first-line parenteral therapy at Sappasithiprasong Hospital for suspected or proven melioidosis after a study published in 1989 showed ceftazidime to be associated with a 50% overall reduction in mortality compared with a combination of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole.17 Improved outcome from melioidosis over the study period may reflect improvements in the standard of medical care provided in provincial Thailand. However, the death rate of 40% is double that reported for patients with melioidosis at the Royal Darwin Hospital in Northern Australia.7 The major cause of death in our melioidosis patients is severe sepsis and the associated organ failure. Most cases are not treated in an intensive-care setting because of limited resources, and we propose that improvements in outcome would require investment in early sepsis management and critical-care facilities. Evidence for the efficacy of improved intensive-care unit management for patients with melioidosis comes from the experience described at the Royal Darwin Hospital.9 There is also anecdotal evidence from Khon Kaen University Hospital in neighboring Khon Kaen province where patients with severe melioidosis are treated in an intensive-care unit wherever possible and the mortality rate is around 20% (P. Chetchotisakd, personal communication)."
1477397,2,"There are several possible explanations for the increasing rate of melioidosis over time. Our method of case ascertainment did not change during the study, but most patients admitted to Sappasithiprasong Hospital were referred from community hospitals situated throughout the province; it is possible that referral patterns have changed over this period. A rise in incidence could also relate to rising life expectancy and a concomitant increase in people with pre-disposing conditions. Data available for life expectancy in Thailand between 1998 and 2004 show a modest increase from 68.9 years in 1998 to 70.3 years in 2004.16 The strongest risk factor for melioidosis is diabetes mellitus, which was shown in this study to put individuals at vastly increased risk of B. pseudomallei infection. The prevalence of diabetes in people in Thailand seems to be rising over time, and the reported rates of diagnosed plus undiagnosed diabetes are 2.3% for 1991, 4.6% for 1996, and 6.7% for 2004.15,16 The adjusted RR of melioidosis for diabetes of 12.4 in this study is consistent with that reported from northern Australia.6 We are not aware of any factors relating to changes in social behavior that would lead to an increase in the rate or duration of exposure to B. pseudomallei in the environment, and no association was found with annual rainfall. Understanding the reasons behind the increasing incidence in melioidosis is important for targeted prevention, and it is the basis of on-going studies."
1477397,3,"A limitation of this study is that the incidence of melioidosis and population mortality rates were based on active surveillance at a single hospital. This provides a minimum estimate for a single province and may not be accurate for the rest of northeast Thailand. To address this, we contacted 19 provincial hospital laboratories in northeast Thailand to obtain data on the number of culture-confirmed cases of melioidosis in 2007. A total of 1,865 culture cases were defined without active surveillance, including 387 patients defined from Ubon Ratchathani provincial hospital laboratory. This is equivalent to an annual incidence rate for northeast Thailand of 8.7 per 100,000 people (95% CI = 8.3–9.1 per 100,000 people), which is a minimum estimate that is significantly higher than the rate reported previously.2 Melioidosis is known to occur in the areas of Laos and Cambodia that are immediately adjacent to northeast Thailand,18–20 but incidence rates are poorly defined and may be grossly underestimated because of a lack of diagnostic microbiology facilities. We predict that melioidosis will become recognized as a major pathogen throughout this region in the wake of laboratory strengthening and use of standard guidelines for the investigation of suspected melioidosis."
1477242,0,"Our enhanced population-based surveillance provides updated estimates of the incidence and in-hospital mortality rate of bacteremic melioidosis among hospitalized patients in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, during 2009–2013. The estimated average annual incidence of bacteremic melioidosis hospitalizations was 14.9 per 100,000 persons, very similar to our previous estimates from 2006 to 2008,9 and slightly higher than a hospital-based study of melioidosis in northeastern Thailand from 1997 to 2006 (12.7 per 100,000 populations).10 Overall incidence showed variability between years from 13 to 17 per 100,000 persons per year with a nonsignificant decrease in in-hospital mortality rate from 2009 to 2013."
1477242,1,"During 2009–2013, our incidence rate is still higher than country reported melioidosis morbidity rate from Thailand’s national surveillance system.28 During our investigation period, the national melioidosis morbidity rate ranged from 2.13 to 6.13 per 100,000 population with mortality rate less than 1%. This likely substantially underestimates the number of melioidosis cases and deaths in Thailand given the passive nature of the national surveillance system. Our investigation’s report showed the advantage of the integration of laboratory information and clinical information from hospitalized pneumonia surveillance to monitor melioidosis in this province. The ideal epidemiological system for monitoring infectious diseases morbidity and mortality would connect laboratory information, clinical information, and death registry data in the integrated reporting mechanism. The high observed incidence among patients aged 55–64 years may be due to this age group likely having higher prevalence of comorbid conditions known to be risk factors for melioidosis17 and having greater occupational exposures (e.g., rice farming).29 As noted in the recent melioidosis global burden of disease estimates, the true burden of this disease is likely still underestimated even in endemic areas.30 There was a marked temporal clustering of hospitalized bacteremic melioidosis patients during the rainy season from July through October similar to what has been reported elsewhere in Thailand and other endemic areas."
1477242,2,"The slight observed decrease in in-hospital mortality rate from 2009 to 2013 could have resulted from detection of more (and possibly less severe) cases through improved blood culturing practices or from improved recognition and awareness of the clinician for treating suspected melioidosis patients, especially during the rainy season since 2006. The in-hospital death of bacteremic melioidosis after installing the automated blood culture system decreased from 29% in 2006 to 21% in 20089 and continued to decrease to 13% in 2013. Previously, the number of in-hospital deaths of hospitalized melioidosis cases in Nakhon Phanom was reported as high as 56% in 2003 and 34% in 2005.32 Given the observed frequency of patients being discharged in poor clinical condition noted mortality could range from a low of 14% when limited to in-hospital deaths to 46% if all patients with poor clinical condition at the time of discharge subsequently died. Unfortunately, our database did not obtain the Thai identification number for tracking out-of-hospital deaths through the national death registry database. Although limited by a low number of patients per month, the in-hospital mortality rate was noted to be highest in November during the cool season, which could suggest lower clinician awareness compared with the rainy season and may indicate a need for continued sensitization of clinicians during non-rainy periods of the year when incidence is lower. Clinicians in endemic regions should have a high index of suspicion for B. pseudomallei infection throughout the year and empirical septicemia treatment guidelines should include antibiotics active against B. pseudomallei.12,17 This is particularly true for patients in the highest risk age-groups (patients aged more than 50 years), those with previously identified risk factors for B. pseudomallei infection such as diabetes mellitus and renal insufficiency, and those groups with likely intense environmental exposure, such as rice farmers and other agricultural workers. During the 5-year analysis period, in-hospital mortality rate was higher among melioidosis patients with pneumonia, which is consistent with recent studies in other locations.2,10 Although limited by the small number of cases annually, the observed decline in in-hospital mortality rates among patients with melioidosis pneumonia deserves further investigation and could relate to greater clinician awareness of melioidosis among severely ill patients with pneumonia."
1477242,3,"There were several limitations to our analyses. First, our investigation underestimated the overall incidence and burden of melioidosis in the province. We did not have information on outpatients or non-bacteremic melioidosis patients, and previous studies have shown that only around 50–60% of melioidosis patients in northeastern Thailand are bacteremic.1 In addition, the sensitivity of blood culture for diagnosis may be as low as 60%,33 so additional testing modalities would likely have identified more case patients. Second, we did not have information on outcome after hospital discharge, and more than a third of surviving patients had their discharge status listed as poor. Not including out-of-hospital outcomes likely led to an underestimation of overall mortality rate. Third, more than 40% of bacteremic melioidosis cases lacked details on clinical characteristics and antibiotic treatment, limiting the ability to assess overall disease severity and the impact of treatment on outcome among hospitalized bacteremic melioidosis patients."
1477242,4,"The burden of bacteremic melioidosis in Nakhon Phanom remains high despite the reduction in in-hospital case fatality seen since the introduction of automated blood culture capacity in the province in 2005. The continued high incidence of bacteremic melioidosis, pneumonia, and associated deaths in an endemic area is concerning given increasing numbers of persons with high-risk conditions such as diabetes, the incidence of which increased from 658 to 894 per 100,000 persons from 2009 to 2013 in Nakhon Phanom province.34 Therefore, maintaining sensitive BSI surveillance, which provides a consistent and comparable method to monitor and track trends in serious invasive infections, is vital to guide the development of affordable strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality. Such surveillance activities are also important for rapidly detecting, responding to, and controlling this public health problem, and thereby contributing to global health security. We encourage clinicians working in B. pseudomallei endemic areas to investigate potential melioidosis patients using standardized, validated microbiological techniques together with CXR, especially for patients presenting with sepsis or acute respiratory symptom in the rainy season. Consistent application of this approach will optimize the opportunity for early diagnosis and targeted treatment to improve outcomes. Increased availability of tests with faster turnaround times than conventional blood culture including sensitive, point-of-care tests or use of advanced molecular methods, may allow for earlier provision of life-saving treatment. Promising options, including PCR, latex agglutination, and lateral flow assays have been recently developed, and evaluations of these tests in the clinical setting are underway.35 In the absence of an approved human vaccine, the identification of alternative prevention measures for melioidosis are urgently needed in high-burden areas, especially for known high-risk groups such as patients with diabetes, renal failure patients, and older adults."
429616,0,"Gene expression profile of cytokines. Our gene expression analysis of melioidosis patient samples did not reveal any statistically significant differential gene expression pattern in comparison with healthy controls (Table 2, Fig 1). The cytokine cascade events following B.pseudomallei infection has been studied in several animal models and show an up regulated mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL6, IL12, IL10, IFNγ, TNFα and IL1β within 72 hours of infection[10, 11, 31, 32]. Studies have also shown an elevated level of expression of IL8, IL6, IL12, IL18, IL15, and IFNγ in plasma of melioidosis patients[12, 33]. Our findings are contrary to a published study showing an increased mRNA expression of inflammatory response genes such as IL6, IL15, IL10, IL4, IFNγ, TNFα and IL1β in melioidosis patients compared to healthy controls [9]. Majority of our samples in the melioidosis cohort, consisted of patients with greater than 10 days of fever/clinical symptoms and antibiotic treatment, in comparison to other studies which have sampled melioidosis patients in early acute phase, within 3 days of antibiotics treatment. This could have been the main reason for the contradicting result. We did not have adequate number of samples in early acute phase of melioidosis (n = 4) to see a statistically significant differential expression compared to healthy controls. Melioidosis patients display differential expression of several immune response genes compared to cases of sepsis resulting from other infections, indicating that the differential expression of these genes can be used as diagnostic marker for melioidosis."
429616,1,"IL4 was up regulated in the melioidosis patients, including the diabetic cohort, compared to other sepsis cases (Tables ​(Tables22 and ​and5,5, Figs ​Figs11 and ​and3).3). IL4 plays a major role in B-cell activation and T-cell proliferation, thus acting as a key regulator of humoral and adaptive immunity. Its role as an anti-inflammatory cytokine participating in decreasing the production of Th1 cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines is suggestive of down regulation of inflammatory responses in melioidosis. Up regulated IL4 expression has been reported in melioidosis patients and acute melioidosis models [9, 13]. Thus, further investigations are currently being carried out on gene expression of IL4 and closely related anti-inflammatory cytokine IL13 in melioidosis patients."
429616,2,"IL8 was significantly down regulated in septicaemic melioidosis patients when compared to other sepsis cases, suggesting that it could be a marker of disease severity (Table 3, Fig 1). IL8 down regulation in early acute melioidosis cases (less than 15 days of fever/clinical symptoms and antibiotic treatment) was also seen compared to other sepsis cases (Table 3, Fig 2). A study using a human lung epithelial cell line showed that IL8 production upon B. pseudomallei infection was lower than cells infected with other gram negative bacteria which is in agreement with our findings [34]. Studies have also shown that B. pseudomallei can activate NF-κB and induce IL8 production without involving TLRs[35]. Increased level of plasma IL8, IL6 concentration being associated with mortality have also been reported[33]. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been reported to be a significant comorbidity associated to melioidosis, particularly septicaemic cases [36]. A study by Morris et al, showed significantly elevated levels of IL8 in plasma of diabetic cohorts compared to non-diabetics 3.5 hours after B. pseudomallei stimulation, suggesting a dysregulated immune response in T2D as underlying factor for susceptibility to melioidosis[37]. Thus IL8, a key mediator of innate immunity associated with inflammation, being down-regulated in early acute stages of melioidosis and in septicaemic cases needs to be investigated further with a larger sample pool, to get a better understanding of IL8’s role in disease severity."
429616,3,"HMGB1, classified as a late onset mediator of sepsis which may function as a pro-inflammatory and anti-bacterial factor [38, 39], was consistently down regulated in melioidosis patients irrespective of other confounding factors like comorbidities (risk factors) and duration of clinical symptoms and treatment, compared to other sepsis infection cases (Tables ​(Tables22–5, Figs ​Figs11–3). Our findings also reveal a significantly up regulated expression of HMGB1 in other sepsis cases compared to healthy controls. HMGBI has been reported to show high levels of expression in plasma of melioidosis patients, particularly septicaemic melioidosis cases compared to other sepsis infections and has been associated with clinical severity and mortality[39]. Some studies have also shown that HMGB1, could induce Th2 type response, leading to increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL4, IL5 etc, while lowering the Th1 type response [40, 41]. HMGB1, plays a key role as an immune modulating factor and its potential role in cell mediated immune dysfunctions ought to be investigated further."
429616,4,"Gene expression profile of Toll-like receptors. TLR2 and TLR4 did not exhibit a differential expression in melioidosis patients compared to healthy controls which is contrary to published studies showing up regulated expression[9, 16]. This contradiction, we believe is also due to variation in duration of clinical symptoms and antibiotic treatment in the studies. However, TLR4 is significantly up regulated in the sepsis cohort, compared to healthy controls (Table 2, Fig 1). As such bothTLR2 and TLR4 are down regulated in the septicaemic melioidosis cases compared to other sepsis infections (Table 2, Fig 1), suggesting poor pathogen recognition. Studies have indicated that LPS of B. pseudomallei signals via TLR2 as opposed to TLR4 being the main receptor for other gram-negative bacteria and TLR-mediated dysregulation of immune response plays a major role in disease pathogenesis [13, 16, 18]. HMGB1 shows a TLR4 dependent activity, with CD14 playing a key role in activation of TLR4 dependent signaling by HMGB1 has also been reported [42, 43].These correspond with our findings of a low level of expression of HMGB1, which plays a major role in activation of TLR4 mediated immune responses, hence down regulation of inflammatory and defense responses upon B. pseudomallei infection."
429616,5,"Gene expression profile of genes associated with the antigen presentation pathway and cell mediated immunity. MICB, PSMB2, PSMB8 and PSME2 showed consistently low level of expression in melioidosis cohort irrespective of other factors like comorbidities (risk factors), duration of clinical symptoms and antibiotic treatment, compared to other sepsis controls (Tables ​(Tables22–5, Figs ​Figs11–3). Low level of expression of these immune response genes which play a major role in antigen presentation and thereby cell mediated immunity, suggests altered defense responses during melioidosis or diminished proteasomal activity at the time of sample collection during later stages of infection. Our findings are contradicting with a similar study that showed differential gene expression pattern of proteasomes and other genes involved in MHC class I & II antigen presentation pathway, where genes PSMB2, PSME2, PSMB8, PSMA5 and HLADMB were over expressed in meliodosis patients compared to other sepsis cases [8].Variations in duration of clinical symptoms, administration of antibiotics at the time of sampling and associated comorbidities could have played a role in this contradicting result, while taking into consideration that the Pankla et al, 2009 study included samples mostly collected within 48 hours of hospitalization. It is also to be noted that the results of this 2009 study has not been independently verified."
429616,6,"Gene expression profile of epigenetic modification factors. There have been extensive studies on the role of epigenetic factors and their association with several communicable and non-communicable diseases [19–21, 25]. DNA methylation, histone deacetylation and methylation are epigenetic modifications associated with a repressed chromatin state, which contributes to repression of gene transcription[44]. Studies have shown that DNMT3B, exhibits an inverse correlation between gene expression levels and DNA methylation levels[19]. A study by Bonsch et al, 2006 showed that genomic DNA hypermethylation was associated with lower mRNA levels of DNMT3B in patients with alcohol dependence [45]. Study by Zong et al 2015, showed that reduction of HDAC activity and expression, was associated with disease severity in smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)[20]. Epigenetic modifications are heavily influenced by practices such as smoking, alcohol dependence[19, 20], diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases [22, 23, 25, 46] which in turn could play a major role in disease pathogenesis and susceptibility."
429616,7,"A recent study on epigenetic changes in human host DNA following B. pseudomallei infection, revealed significant changes in DNA methylation in the vincity of genes involved in inflammatory responses, intracellular signaling, apoptosis and pathogen induced signaling, suggesting that DNA methylation changes could be altering gene transcription thus affecting key immune pathways [47]. High throughput gene expression analysis in melioidosis have not revealed strong association of epigenetic factors with B. pseudomallei infection [8]. However, extensive study in this area is required. While this study on whole-genome transcriptional profiles of septicaemic melioidosis and sepsis caused by other infections has revealed a transcriptional signature [8], those findings were never validated in an independent study. Therefore, we found it necessary to follow up on those studies, as well as investigate a unique set of target genes involved in epigenetic regulation to evaluate whether the expression of the epigenetics markers were deferentially regulated in melioidosis compared to sepsis caused by other infections. While those genes were not found to be deferentially expressed in whole-genome studies [8], given the relapse and reactivation of infection in susceptible groups, it was of interest to further investigate the transcription profiles of this set of genes involved in epigenetic modifications."
429616,8,"Our study investigated the differential expression of several epigenetic regulators in melioidosis. DNMT3B, responsible for DNA methylation, HDAC1 and HDAC2, responsible for histone deacetylation were significantly down regulated in melioidosis patients compared to other sepsis cases irrespective of confounding factors like duration of fever/clinical symptoms, antibiotic treatment and associated comorbidities (Tables ​(Tables22–5, Figs ​Figs11–3). Thus, correlation between mRNA levels of DNMT’s and levels of methylation ought to be analyzed further. Our comparison of melioidosis patients with regular alcohol consumption habit (n = 8) and sepsis controls (n = 10) showed a similar expression pattern to the entire melioidosis cohort (n = 30), in addition to down regulated expression of DNMT3A and IL8 (Table 5, Fig 3). We could observe a significantly lower level of expression of the epigenetic factors in melioidosis cases compared to sepsis controls, while assessing alcohol consumption as a risk factor, indicating its confounding effect."
429616,9,"From our studies we find that epigenetic factors HDAC1, HDAC2 and DNMT3B show consistent differential expression compared to other sepsis cases, suggesting a role in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. However, further studies such as DNA methylation arrays with a larger sample pool and further analysis of confounding comorbidities, is required to fully understand the role of epigenetic mechanisms in relation to pathogenesis of melioidosis."
429616,10,"Limitation of study. The main limitation of our study was that the melioidosis patient samples were collected well after start of antibiotic treatment which may affect immunocompetant cells, which in turn affects the immune response genes investigated. Studies have shown that antibiotics like meropenem exert an immunomodulatory effect, affecting the production of some cytokines in PBMC’s [48]. This may have been the main reason, as to why we could not see any significant differential expression of some key inflammatory response cytokines such as IFNγ, especially between the melioidosis and healthy cohorts, while similar studies have sampled within 3 days of antibiotic treatment. Duration of clinical symptoms ranged from >10 days to >90 days and duration of antibiotics treatment ranged from 1 day to >30 days at the time of blood collection for all the melioidosis samples. Since our sample collection was nationwide, duration between patient identification/ disease confirmation and sampling was substantial due to logistical issues. Thus, due to wide range of duration of infection and limited number of samples with ≤15 days of fever (n = 4) we could not evaluate statistically significant differential expression of inflammatory genes during the early stages of infection. Melioidosis is severely under-reported and under-diagnosed in Sri Lanka and most patients who get hospitalized and diagnosed of the disease, are already in a later stage of infection. This makes it very difficult to carryout investigations with patient samples within an early stage of infection and or anti-microbial therapy. While its important to gather information on expression levels of host factors during early acute phase of infection, it is also imperative to have some understanding on expression levels of important host genes during later stages of infection like in our study, which may be useful to monitor antibiotic treatment regimes. As we see diabetes as a major comorbidity in our experimental cohort, we analyzed our data to see if there was any significant differential expression between diabetic melioidosis cases and non-diabetic melioidosis cases. The gene expression between these two groups were comparable and we could not find any statistically significant differential expression due to diabetes (S3 Table). Therefore, our results show a consistent differential expression of HMGB1, MICB, PSMB8, PSMB2, PSME2, HDAC1, HDAC2 and DNMT3B when compared to other sepsis cases, irrespective of comorbidities (risk factors), duration of fever/clinical symptoms and antibiotic treatment, primarily due to melioidosis infection. We also note that gene expression analyses of blood leukocytes only provide insight in immune pathways regulated at mRNA level in circulating cells, hence we look to expand our future study on a proteomic level as well. We also take note of the limitation of IHA test used in this study for diagnosis of melioidosis. Though the sensitivity and specificity of IHA test is limited, it has been used worldwide as a laboratory method for melioidosis diagnosis. The bacterial loads of patient samples are not always high for culture positive results, with general antibiotic treatment playing an intervening role. Hence IHA test results were included, as they serve as a useful reference for melioidosis diagnosis."
429616,11,"Conclusion. Our findings did not show significant differential expression among the immune response genes and the epigenetic modifiers in melioidosis cases and the healthy controls. However, our study indicates differential expression in inflammatory responses, defense responses and epigenetic factors during melioidosis compared to other cases of sepsis, thus differential gene expression among the genes under investigation that can distinguish melioidosis cases from other sepsis infections. These findings suggest that the differentially expressed genes during melioidosis should be validated during different stages of infection for their potential as markers of disease diagnosis and for therapeutic intervention. Thus, our future studies shall be aimed at studying gene expression profiles in early and late acute phases of melioidosis and also looking into susceptible groups for further study on disease severity. Studies would also be broadened into the four areas showing differential gene expression pattern- key cytokines, antigen presentation pathways, toll-like receptor signaling pathways and epigenetic chromatin modifying enzymes. Further investigations to confirm these findings in a larger cohort is needed, which may validate the potential of these differentially expressed genes to serve as disease biomarkers that could pave the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for melioidosis intervention."
1807783,0,Whether meropenem can reduce mortality in acute melioidosis remains unclear. The only published trial comparing a carbapenem with ceftazidime in severe cases found a modest and non-significant reduction in mortality.4 The outcomes of a clinical trial comparing ceftazidime and meropenem in severe melioidosis are not yet available (NCT00579956).
1807783,1,"In addition to the scanty evidence are a number of other limitations. First, we assume general sepsis guidelines would be effective in classification of severity. If this is wrong, some non-severe cases could receive the more costly treatment unnecessarily, while more severe cases would be denied the potential advantage offered by meropenem. Second, we assume both treatments are equally effective in empirically treated non-melioidosis cases. Third, due to methodological challenges we did not include the societal cost of carbapenem-resistant organisms following increased use of meropenem."
1807783,2,"Costs and other key parameter estimates are specific to the Thai context, therefore our recommendations may not be generalizable to other settings. However, the model could be adopted and re-analyzed with other sites' specific parameters to identify the cost-effective treatment strategies for acute melioidosis."
1807783,3,"Conclusions. Notwithstanding the limited evidence, we conclude that use of meropenem in patients with suspected severe melioidosis is likely to be cost-effective in northeast Thailand, assuming even a modest reduction in mortality. This strategy also resembles the standard guidelines of melioidosis treatment in Australia.5 Empirical meropenem treatment for all acute cases, however, is less likely to be cost-effective unless the reduction in mortality is much higher than indicated by a previous clinical trial.4 This analysis should be repeated once better evidence become available."
428872,0,"In the current study, we investigated derangements of VWF in the host defense against septic melioidosis. Thrombocytopenia has been observed incidentally in previous cases of melioidosis [32, 33] and so we first sought evidence of thrombocytopenia in melioidosis, since platelet counts are routinely available as part of the initial assessment of all sepsis patients. We found that thrombocytopenia is a feature of sepsis caused by B. pseudomallei and is correlated with mortality."
428872,1,"The concept that platelets are the chief cellular effector of hemostasis is well established [34], however in very recent years we and others have showed in two preclinical studies that platelets also function as key effector players in the host response against bacterial infections [35, 36]. Of note, mice treated with the platelet depleting antibody (α-GpIbα) had a strongly impaired host response when intranasally challenged with Gram-negative bacteria leading to increased bacterial growth and a decreased survival [35]. Additionally, a recent clinical study which included a heterogeneous group of 913 consecutive patients with sepsis, blood microarray analysis revealed a distinct gene expression pattern in sepsis patients, low platelet counts, showing reduced signaling in leukocyte adhesion and diapedesis and increased complement signaling [37]. Platelets interact with the innate immune system through different mechanisms; direct bacterial killing, immunothrombosis, recruitment of neutrophils, and by potentiating effects such as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) production [5, 38]. NETs form a central role in the host response against invading pathogens, and entrap and kill bacteria. We previously showed that melioidosis patients had increased levels of NET-related components and that NETs have antibacterial activity against B. pseudomallei [39]. However, NET formation did not protect against bacterial dissemination or inflammation in a murine B. pseudomallei-induced sepsis model [39]."
428872,2,"In septic patients, the development of thrombocytopenia is secondary to various mechanism [40]; platelets are activated and bound to endothelium, resulting in sequestration and destruction [41]. It remains unclear whether reduced platelet counts lead directly to adverse clinical outcome in sepsis, or whether they are simply a biomarker for disease severity at presentation [42]. We show that thrombocytopenia is related with progression to death in melioidosis which is probably associated with a more disturbed host response [37]. However, further clinical and animal studies on the exact role of platelets and platelet neutrophil interactions in the host response against B. pseudomallei infection are needed."
428872,3,"In our study, VWF antigen levels were higher in melioidosis patients compared to controls, however not correlated with mortality. We showed that excess circulating VWF in melioidosis is correlated with excess secretion and reduced ADAMST13. Our finding that ADAMST13 activity is decreased in melioidosis is consistent with the wider sepsis literature which finds that ADAMST13 deficiency is a common feature of severe sepsis both in adults [30] and in children [20]. This decline of ADAMST13 may be explained by the presence of proinflammatory cytokines in septic patients [22], which suppress mRNA transcription encoding ADAMTS13 [43]. ADAMST13 was decreased in non-surviving patients potentially reflecting the decrease of proteolytic activity of this enzyme in sepsis [31, 44]. However, literature contains conflicting data on the utility of VWF and ADAMTS13 as predictors of outcome in sepsis [16]. In a single-center observational study of 40 patients conducted as part of a larger randomized-controlled trial of C1-inhitbitor supplementation in all-cause sepsis they show that ADAMST13 levels were lower and VWF antigen levels were higher in severe sepsis or septic shock [31]. Neither ADAMST13 nor VWF parameters correlated with outcome. In our study, the range of ADAMST13 values felt within the normal range. We therefore, can conclude that ADAMTS13 is of no prognostic value in melioidosis. Moreover, as the link between ADAMST13 levels and VWF antigen is not as strong and the correlation with mortality is weak, novel strategies for the adjunctive treatment of sepsis such as ADAMTS13 supplementation that have been proposed for the management of all-cause sepsis [44] are also less likely to be beneficial in melioidosis."
428872,4,"Interestingly, there was no correlation between VWF and thrombocytopenia, suggesting that excess VWF is not the primary driver of thrombocytopenia in melioidosis. We note, incidentally, that other additional mechanisms may contribute to the accumulation of VWF during sepsis: for example, oxidative modification of VWF in sepsis has been shown to prevent cleavage of VWF by ADAMST13 [45, 46]. Another potential driver of thrombocytopenia includes diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) [47]. Activation of the coagulation pathway may be deleterious when the triggered blood coagulation is insufficiently controlled. This could lead to DIC and microvascular thrombosis. Reduced level of ADAMTS13, as we showed in this study, has been reported in DIC due to severe sepsis [30]. However, the median DIC score from this melioidosis cohort, as calculated using the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) standardized method was 3 (2–4), indicating that DIC is not overt [9, 48]. More studies focusing on DIC in melioidosis patients are needed."
428872,5,"Additionally, hemophagocytosis, a life-threatening condition of excessive immune activation, has been postulated to drive sepsis-related thrombocytopenia. Proliferation of macrophages, leading to uncontrolled phagocytosis of platelets, erythrocytes and lymphocytes characterizes the macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) [49, 50]. It could very well be that a significant portion of our patients have MAS, which can be defined as having five of the following eight features: fever, splenomegaly, peripheral blood cytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hyperfibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, lymph node of liver, diminished NK cell activity, high ferritin levels and elevated soluble CD35 [51]. Unfortunately, most of these markers are not available for our patients. This is an interesting area to further explore. Patients with sepsis associated MAS might benefit from interleukin-1 receptor blockade [50]. In this respect, it is of interest that both the administration of anti-IL-1ra as well as anti-IL-1b protects against experimental melioidosis [52, 53]."
428872,6,"To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that studies the impact of VWF, ADAMST13 and platelets in patients with melioidosis. However, study limitations need to be considered. First, we only included patients with diabetes in this study. We made this decision, because diabetes itself is associated with abnormalities of coagulation, anticoagulation and fibrinolysis [54]. In addition, the majority of patients with melioidosis have diabetes and we were not interested in the effect of diabetes on coagulation during melioidosis, because this has been investigated extensively elsewhere [9]. Second, the number of patients analyzed was restricted due to financial constraints for the assays. Third, although to the best of our knowledge no intersex differences in VWF and ADAMTS13 levels have been described, it should be mentioned that the male/female ratio of controls differs from patients."
428872,7,"Conclusions. In conclusion, thrombocytopenia is a feature of sepsis caused by B. pseudomallei and is correlated with mortality. Excess VWF is a feature of acute melioidosis and is likely driven by both by increased secretion of VWF propeptide in endothelium and by reduced clearance by ADAMTS13. However, the thrombocytopenia of melioidosis is likely not driven by excess VWF: other possible drivers include diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemophagocytosis. In the past years, tremendous progress has been made toward our understandings of the protective roll of platelets in sepsis and the possibility in the use of thrombocytopenia as biomarker [35, 37]. More animal and human studies are necessary to understand the reason of thrombocytopenia in septic melioidosis patients and to translate this to clinical practice."
432177,0,"To our knowledge, this is the most extensive systematic review of individual participant data of case reports and case series on the CNS melioidosis. However, the critical issue is that some data were not reported by the author, and we do not know if such variables were absent or not evaluated. This missing data issue makes the data percentage look higher than actual values so the results should be cautiously interpreted."
432177,1,"Like all melioidosis, most CNS melioidosis also occurred in the endemic regions especially northern Australia and Thailand. Some cases developed in the non-endemic region, however, they all had a history of physical presence in the endemic area where they could contact the soil or water before. Because B. pseudomallei infection can be latent for an extended period, it can then reactivate the disease later like CNS tuberculosis. For example, Beck et al. reported a case of melioidosis meningitis from the US who served during the Vietnam War 13 years ago [5]. This pattern of disease occurrence leads melioidosis to be known as the “Vietnam time bomb”. Some occupations, such as rice farmer, have a potential risk for percutaneous inoculation of the organism via exposure to soils or water."
432177,2,"The pathogenesis of CNS melioidosis appears to be different among the cases. Firstly, hematogenous spreading of the microorganism to the CNS plays an essential role in the disease mechanism. It is supported by the study’s result that blood is the most common specimen that isolates B. pseudomallei. The circulating bacteria can cross the cellular barriers, which include the blood-brain barrier and blood-CSF barrier, using three methods: transcellular, paracellular or Trojan horse method [6]. The latter mode occurs when the bacteria can survive within the circulating monocytes which can cross the cerebral endothelium via L-selectin (CD62L) mediated migration [7]. Secondly, as evidence from the animal studies, direct brainstem invasion through the nasal passage and cranial nerves is believed to be another distinguish mechanism of CNS melioidosis especially encephalomyelitis type [8]. This mechanism is supported by the results from Darwin study [1] which demonstrated low bacteremic rate for encephalomyelitis in comparison to brain abscess (21% vs. 100%). However, our review has found that the bacteremic rates between cases of encephalomyelitis and brain abscess were quite similar (54% vs. 58%). Finally, percutaneous inoculation over the scalp and subsequent direct extension to the skull and brain may be responsible for the pathophysiology of particular cases. This is supported by the observation that 25 percent of CNS melioidosis patients also had concurrent skull osteomyelitis or scalp abscess, and some indeed reported the history of preceding cranial injury."
432177,3,"All age groups and both sexes could have CNS melioidosis, although most patients were adult males. However, the proportion of children to adult is much higher for the CNS melioidosis (23%) compared to all melioidosis (5%) from the prospective study in northern Australia [9]. CNS melioidosis is a heterogeneous disease that can present as encephalomyelitis, brain abscess, isolated meningitis or isolated extra-axial collection. Most cases of encephalomyelitis were reported from northern Australia, while regional genotypic differences between B. pseudomallei strains may explain this geographical restriction [10]. Encephalitic syndrome without myelitis became the dominant presentation of encephalomyelitis type. Fever is the most common manifestation, although it also occurs in various infectious diseases. Focal neurological deficits especially cranial nerve palsies are also prominent features of this CNS melioidosis type, in which lesions are mainly located in the brainstem (48%). Sixth, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth cranial nerves are most commonly involved. These cranial nerve deficits can be found in the brainstem encephalitis of other causes as well including Listeria monocytogenes, herpes simplex virus type 1, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [11,12,13]. Despite its common brainstem attack, alteration of consciousness develops in only half of cases. Other subtypes of encephalomyelitis include combined encephalitis with myelitis and isolated myelitis. Patients with pure myelitis usually present with classic spinal cord syndrome including paraparesis or quadriparesis accompanying by sensory level and bowel-bladder dysfunction. For brain abscess type, focal neurological deficit, i.e., unilateral weakness is the most common feature; however, cranial nerve palsies occur infrequently. Unlike brain abscess from other causes [14], presentation with fever is more prevalent in melioidosis (74%). Headache is still a common symptom, and most patients have conscious changes. Neck stiffness appears to be associated with occipital lobe abscess. Clinical features of melioidosis meningitis remain similar to other meningitis syndromes which encompass fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Isolated extra-axial collection of melioidosis has not been reported in children so far. Fever remains the most common presentation while headache, focal neurological deficits or seizures is not a reliable indicator of melioidosis subdural empyema or epidural abscess."
432177,4,"Interestingly, CNS melioidosis patients can initially present with cranial swelling, which is associated with infection of extracranial structures such as scalp abscess, parotid abscess or orbital abscess. This manifestation may be the result of direct extension from the intracranial pathology or led by the organism inoculation into structures themselves. Although many organisms other than B. pseudomallei can cause pneumonia and skin infection, these two organs involved in the CNS melioidosis were not uncommon. Some cases have the splenic abscess, a rare disease which is generally caused by a handful of pathogens including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus [15]. Moreover, prostatitis or prostatic abscess, which is typically caused by Enterobacteriaceae, was also observed in some cases of CNS melioidosis."
432177,5,"The CSF profile of CNS melioidosis, which commonly shows pleocytosis with mononuclear cells predominance, is comparable to tuberculous or viral meningitis. Nevertheless, tuberculous meningitis typically shows a lower CSF glucose level and higher CSF protein concentration. The CSF polymorphonuclear cells predominance can be demonstrated in one-third of CNS melioidosis patients. This variable characteristic of cells dominance is also shown on the Listeria meningoencephalitis [11]."
432177,6,"Contrast-enhanced MRI is the neuroimaging study of choice for CNS melioidosis because of its high sensitivity. Brain CT may appear normal if it is done early. Therefore, MRI should be further undergone in case CNS melioidosis is still in the differential diagnosis. Brainstem lesions are seen to be prominent in the encephalomyelitis type. Some authors suggested that CNS melioidosis shows a propensity to involve and spread along the white matter tracts across the commissural or longitudinal fibers [16,17]. This may explain the study’s result that a reasonable proportion of encephalomyelitis patients had lesions involving both supra- and infratentorial structures as well as the spinal cord. However, isolated supratentorial lesions are found to be the most common findings of all CNS melioidosis and even all encephalomyelitis types. Interestingly, some parenchymal lesions also involve adjacent subdural or epidural spaces, skull and extracranial structures. This invasive behavior is similar to tuberculosis, invasive fungal infection and malignant neoplasms."
432177,7,"Culture from the CNS specimen is the best way to establish a definite diagnosis of CNS melioidosis. These sources encompass 1) brain tissue 2) pus from the brain or subdural collection or epidural abscess and 3) CSF. However, it is hard to obtain the specimen from some pathogenic location such as the brainstem. As a result, the diagnosis can be made by the presentation of the compatible CNS diseases that is supported by positive cultures from other specimens. The hemoculture yields a positive result in the highest sensitivity with 52 percent. Other samples including sputum, skin pus, osteomyelitic skull, and scalp abscess would be helpful for the diagnosis. Although we included 9 CNS melioidosis cases who were diagnosed by only serology in our review, the indirect hemagglutinin assay (IHA) alone is not reliable enough for diagnosis in clinical practice because of its problematic false positive and false negative [18,19]."
432177,8,"Once the diagnosis of CNS melioidosis was made, most cases were treated with appropriate drugs both in the intensive- and eradication-phase therapies. According to the 2010 consensus recommendations, ceftazidime and meropenem are the drugs of choice for intensive-phase therapy, while trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the first-line drug for eradication-phase therapy [20]. Some medications including chloramphenicol and doxycycline were used in intensive-phase therapy in some CNS melioidosis cases; however, they are not effective thus should be avoided. The treatment duration is also a key to success that eight weeks and six months are the minimal duration for intensive- and eradication-phase therapy, respectively [21]. However, we found that most non-death cases were treated inadequately. Although most cases of CNS melioidosis completely or partially recovered following treatment, one-fifth finally succumbed to the disease."
432177,9,"There are several limitations to our study besides the missing data issue. We identified only the CNS melioidosis cases that were presented in the literature. However, we believe that the CNS melioidosis patients were still underreported especially in the endemic regions of melioidosis. The precise diagnosis of CNS melioidosis types which differentiates encephalomyelitis from brain abscess was not definite. Some large rim-enhancing lesions diagnosed with brain abscess might be progressed from prior microabscesses, which is recognized as encephalomyelitis type. On the other hand, in encephalomyelitis, abnormal imaging findings other than rim enhancement may be cerebritis, early stage of brain abscess. Moreover, the contrast-enhanced imaging characteristics including nodular, irregular and linear enhancement were not explicitly defined on the reports."
432177,10,"Conclusions. The CNS melioidosis mostly occurs in adults, and diabetes mellitus is the most common risk factor. Encephalomyelitis and brain abscess are the major types of the disease which fever, unilateral weakness, and cranial nerve deficits are the most prominent presenting features. The CSF profile usually shows mononuclear pleocytosis with high protein and normal glucose level. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the most sensitive imaging study for detecting brain lesions. The rim-enhancing pattern is the most frequent finding, and the brainstem is the most affected location. One-fifth of the patients is fatal. The interpretation from this study may be biased as there were several missing data from the case reports and case series."
1974798,0,"A recent disease burden study suggested that there are around 165,000 cases and 89,000 deaths due to melioidosis every year and that the disease is endemic in at least some parts of 83 geographies. Our impact and cost-effectiveness modelling indicates that a melioidosis vaccine targeted at high-risk populations living in environmentally suitable areas for melioidosis transmission could reduce the burden of this disease in these populations and be cost-effective. To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the impact and economic consequences of melioidosis vaccination from a global perspective. In addition, this is the first study systematically quantifying the relative risk of melioidosis in different groups by pooling evidence from a review of observational studies."
1974798,1,"Only one cost-effectiveness study of melioidosis vaccination has been published; this was restricted to north-eastern Thailand but also found vaccination to be potentially cost-effective [7]. Our analysis extends this by considering all geographies with endemic melioidosis, a wide range of risk factors based on a synthesis of studies in the literature, and a range of vaccine strategies. By targeting the vaccine to the population at greatest risk, we can ensure that vaccination is cost-effective even when its duration of protection is short (5 years)."
1974798,2,"In addition, with the trend of increasing prevalence of chronic renal disease and diabetes in some of the endemic countries, the size of the high-risk population could increase considerably in the near future, making the vaccine more cost-effective [25, 26]. The long-term prognosis for these chronic diseases is improving in many countries, again making the protection from a melioidosis vaccine potentially more valuable in the future. On the other hand, melioidosis patients may have better survival prospects due to the better quality and accessibility of treatment [34]."
1974798,3,"The potential target areas for vaccination were determined from a study that determined environmentally suitable areas for melioidosis with very high spatial resolution (5 × 5 km2). However, the environmentally suitable areas generally do not correspond to administrative boundaries between or within countries, especially in large geographies such as Australia, China and India. In practice, it may be easier to target vaccination strategies by administrative units such as provinces or states based on average risks within those units. Improving surveillance systems at both the local and global levels would also strengthen the robustness of data informing such decisions."
1974798,4,"This study has several limitations. Firstly, we considered three risk factors for melioidosis in our evaluation: age over 45 years, diabetes and chronic renal disease. These have been consistently identified as some of the most important risk factors for melioidosis in studies. However, other attributes have also been identified as potential risk factors, although they are less consistently reported and/or have smaller reported relative risks. They include male gender, chronic lung disease, thalassaemia, excessive alcohol consumption and being an indigenous Australian [2, 12]. Further data about melioidosis relative risks and prevalence of these risk factors at the country level may help more precisely targeted vaccination strategies that could increase vaccine impact and cost-effectiveness further."
1974798,5,"Secondly, many parameters around treatment protocols and costs were estimated for broad categories of geographies stratified by income level. Furthermore, some parameters had to be established through expert elicitation due to limitations in available data. Economic studies at the country/territory level could help establish more reliable estimates of the economic burden of melioidosis."
1974798,6,"Moreover, in the absence of explicit cost-effectiveness threshold in most of the evaluated countries, we adopted one GDP per capita to be the threshold which has been widely used in low- and middle-income settings [30]. However, recent modelling evidence suggests that GDP per capita thresholds are much higher than the actual heath opportunity costs in several countries [35, 36]. Hence, our findings may require careful interpretation and ideally supplemented by country-level analyses using local thresholds and deliberative processes."
1974798,7,"Lastly, as no melioidosis vaccines have entered human trials to date, we made broad assumptions about the potential cost, protective efficacy and duration of protection afforded by a vaccine. Our assumptions have been fairly conservative: we assumed short duration (5 years), imperfect efficacy (50–80%) and vaccine cost assumptions based on one of the most commercially successful vaccines to date (human papillomavirus vaccine). By doing so, our analysis establishes the minimal characteristics of a vaccine that can be successful in commercial and public health terms for vaccine developers to aim for. Even with 50% protective efficacy assumption in sensitivity analysis, a cost-effective vaccine strategy still exists in 51 out of 83 melioidosis endemic countries. If a melioidosis vaccine is brought to market with longer duration, better efficacy or a lower price, then it will be even more cost-effective than we report."
