822569,0,"3.1. Demographic features. Since the first report in 2003, 11 cases of imported melioidosis have been reported in South Korea. The mean age of the patients was 52.3 years, ranging from 32 years to 66 years. Ten patients (90.9%) were older than 45 years, and all patients were male. With regard to their occupations, the patients included businessmen (36.3%), construction workers (18.2%), welders (18.2%), engineers (9.1%), drivers (9.1%), and actors (9.1%). The demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical features of the patients are summarized in Table 1."
822569,1,"3.2. Epidemiologic features. All the patients had visited Southeast Asia, which is a traditional endemic region for melioidosis. The countries from which melioidosis were imported included Malaysia (27.3%), Thailand (27.3%), Cambodia (18.2%), Philippines (9.1%), Indonesia (9.1%), and Vietnam (9.1%). Domestic cases of melioidosis have never been reported in South Korea, based on previous epidemiological investigations, and so all cases are thought to be imported. Nine patients had stayed in the endemic region for >1 month. However, two patients developed melioidosis after a few days of travel to the endemic region. Four patients developed symptoms during their stay in the endemic region and were diagnosed with melioidosis after returning to South Korea. The remaining seven patients developed initial symptoms after returning to South Korea. Of these patients, the interval between returning to South Korea and symptom onset ranged from 1 day to 3 years. Seven patients had at least one risk factor for melioidosis. Diabetes mellitus was the most frequent risk factor (63.6%), followed by lung cancer (9.1%) and chronic kidney disease (9.1%)."
822569,2,"3.3. Clinical manifestations. Eight patients had acute infections (symptom duration of <2 months) and three had chronic infection (symptoms for > 2 months). Of these 11 patients seven (63.6%) presented with pneumonia, three (27.3%) with genitourinary infection, and one (9.1%) with soft tissue infection. Abscess formation was observed in the prostate in three patients, and in the spleen and liver in one patient. Three patients had septic shock on admission with evidence of organ dysfunction, all of whom underwent rapid progression of the disease and died. Nine patients were bacteremic. In the remaining two patients, B. pseudomallei grew in bronchoscopic washing and surgical specimen obtained by pulmonary lobectomy. Four patients died and seven patients survived without relapse."
822569,3,"Of the five patients reported since 2011, two patients showed unusual clinical manifestation. Case 1 had a coinfection with pulmonary tuberculosis and melioidosis. The patient initially presented with chronic cough, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured in a lung biopsy. The patient underwent antitubercular therapy. However, the cough persisted, and the patient underwent a left upper lobectomy more than a year after returning from the endemic region. The surgical specimen grew B. pseudomallei. Case 5 was the first melioidosis patient in South Korea presented with a mycotic aneurysm of the aorta. The patient initially developed dysuria and was diagnosed with a prostate abscess. Although fever subsided after the treatment, fever recurred about 50 days after its onset. The subsequent diagnostic workup revealed a mycotic aneurysm of the aorta. The patient underwent surgical treatment of the aneurysm, and blood and the surgical specimen grew B. pseudomallei."
435540,0,"The demographic sub-model was able to reproduce the past population structure of Thailand from 1980 to the present (see S2 Figure A). The parameters that characterized seasonal movement were estimated by fitting the model to the population movement data (see S2 Figure B). The model showed that majority of movements were made by Northeast individuals who moved to non-Northeast areas, approximately 13,600 persons per 100,000 population per month, or 34% of all movements within a month (see S1 Table A). Moreover, the majority of movements were among those aged between 15 and 60 years old, about 19,000 persons per 100,000 population per month, or 51% of all movements within a month (see S2 Figure C)."
435540,1,"The fitting performance is shown in Fig 2. Melioidosis cases occurred seasonally, with a peak in the wet season that lasted from May to October. The infection parameters that minimized the fit statistic, using the Bayesian method, are shown in Table 1. The highest infection rate was estimated to be 6 cases per 100,000 population per month among males aged 45–59 years old in the Northeast. The lowest rate was 0.4 cases per 100,000 population per month among females aged 15–44 years old in the non-Northeast region. Surprisingly, we found that the infection rate among the transient male population aged 15–44 years was higher than the non-Northeast population (0.8 compared with 0.08 per 100,000 persons per month). Overall 46% of melioidosis cases were symptomatic. Recovery rates for untreated symptomatic cases and asymptomatic patients were estimated by the model, with the average period of infection estimated at around 9 and 5 months, respectively. The susceptibility to melioidosis among DM population is 10.84 [95% CI 8.42–12.23] times greater than the non-DM population. If patients’ treatment failed and they developed severe melioidosis, they could die within two weeks. We estimated 80% and 50% under-reporting of cases in 2008–2009 and 2010–2015, respectively."
435540,2,"Projections of the numbers of melioidosis cases between 2015 and 2035 are given in Fig 3. Total melioidosis incidence per year was projected to increase by 70%, from 6,569 (4,834–8,701) in 2015 to 11,173 (8,207–14,773) in 2035. The largest increase of melioidosis was projected to occur among the population aged 45–59 years old. The predicted incidence among males was two-fold greater than that of females. The majority of melioidosis cases were seen to occur in the population from the Northeast region of Thailand. The predicted incidence among non-diabetic was two-fold greater than that of diabetic population."
435540,3,"In Fig 4, total melioidosis incidence rates were projected to increase by approximately 10% by 2035, from 11.42 (8.5–13.4) in 2015 to 12.78 (9.6–14.9) per 100,000 population in 2035 (see Table 2). The highest incidence rates were predicted to be among those aged between 45–59 years old, followed by those age 60 years old and above. The incidence was almost double among males compared with females in both Northeast and other regions. The incidence rate among the Northeast population was more than double compared with the transient population, and almost ten times higher when compared with the other regions. This study also highlighted the importance of melioidosis among the transient population who temporally live in the risk area but had almost six times higher incidence compared with other regional populations. From diabetes prospective, the incidence of melioidosis among diabetes was predicted to be as high as 60 per 100,000 population. To summary, the risk of melioidosis among the aging population with some chronic diseases such as diabetes is presenting an increasing trend. The risk of infection among transient population, who temporary get some disease exposure during the agricultural seasons, cannot be ignored."
2515873,0,"The melioidosis cohort consisted of 30 patients and 30 controls. Baseline characteristics are in Table 1. In the melioidosis cohort, 6,755 probes were differentially expressed (that is, either up or downregulated) representing 4632 unique genes. Annotation was available for 1,658 of these genes, of which 651 were upregulated and 1,007 were downregulated. The tuberculosis cohort consisted of 20 patients and 24 controls. In the tuberculosis cohort, 6911 probes differentially expressed (5045 unique genes). Annotation was available for 1985 of these genes, of which 847 were upregulated and 1138 were downregulated. In both the melioidosis and the tuberculosis cohorts, the signature seen was dominated by neutrophils, which formed the bulk of the circulating leukocytes. Multiple lymphocyte-related pathways were downregulated, but this reflects the fact that lymphocyte counts were low in both melioidosis and tuberculosis. Pathways associated with transcription and translation were also prominent, in keeping with the large number of genes differentially regulated in both melioidosis and tuberculosis."
2515873,1,"Pathway Analysis. Interferon-mediated responses were the dominant pathway seen in both melioidosis and in tuberculosis (p<0.0001 for both, Tables 2 & 3). Class 1 and class 2 interferons were prominent in both (Table 4). Of the immune-related pathways, TRAIL (TNF superfamily member 10), tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-12, chemokine and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways were all differentially regulated (Tables 2 & 3). There was no gene signature that distinguished melioidosis from tuberculosis, and for each of the pathways differentially expressed in melioidosis, we were able to find a counterpart in tuberculosis (Tables 2 & 3). Berry et al. reported an 86-gene signature that was specific for tuberculosis [7]. This 86-gene signature was also present in melioidosis (Figure 1)."
2515873,2,"Modular Analysis. In a modular analysis of the upregulated genes (Figure 2A), interferon and cytokine signalling clustered together in the centre of the network, causing the complement (cluster 1), NOD-like receptor (cluster 2) and TLR (cluster 3) pathways to gain prominence. In the downregulated genes (Figure 2B), the most prominent clusters were the ribosomal proteins (cluster 1) and zinc finger proteins (cluster 2)."
2515873,3,"PAMP-specific Responses. B. pseudomallei expresses lipopolysaccharide on its outer membrane, while M. tuberculosis does not and has a lipid-rich cell wall. Lipopolysaccharide is recognized by TLR4 and CD14, and both are upregulated in melioidosis (P = 0.0016 and 1.5 × 10–6, respectively); however, TLR4 and CD14 are also upregulated in tuberculosis (P = 1.5 × 10–6 and 9.4 × 10–4). B. pseudomallei is a flagellated, motile bacterium, while M. tuberculosis is immotile with no flagellum. Flagellin is a ligand for TLR5 [25] and NLRC4 [26]. Both TLR5 and NLRC4 were upregulated in melioidosis (P = 5.4 × 10–13 and 4.2 × 10–10, respectively), but both were upregulated in tuberculosis also (P = 8.1 × 10–10 and 2.4 × 10–11)."
1477397,0,"Incidence of melioidosis. A total of 2,243 patients were admitted to Sappasithiprasong Hospital between 1997 and 2006 with their first episode of culture-confirmed melioidosis. Overall, 24% of cases were diagnosed as a result of active case finding on the medical and intensive-care wards. The average annual incidence rate for the province during the 10-year study period was 12.7 cases per 100,000 people per year, but the rate showed considerable variability over time (Table 1). A year-on-year increase was observed between 2000 and 2006, and an annual incidence (100,000 people) of 8.0 (95% CI = 7.2–10.0) in 2000 rose to 21.3 (95% CI = 19.2–23.6) in 2006 (P < 0.001; χ2 test for trend). There was a negative association between the total annual rainfall and the number of melioidosis cases in each year (Spearman's ρ = −0.89; P < 0.001) (Table 1)."
1477397,1,"Incidence of melioidosis by age, gender, and diabetes. Twenty-seven patients were excluded from this analysis, because the history of underlying diseases was not recorded. Of the 2,217 patients remaining, 1,296 (58.5%) were male, and 921 (41.5%) were female. Median age was 49 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 37–60 years), and 199 patients (9.0%) were younger than 15 years of age. A total of 662 patients (29.9%) were patients with known diabetes, and an additional 370 patients (16.7%) were defined as having previously undiagnosed diabetes at presentation with melioidosis. The previously undiagnosed diabetes group was made up of 222 patients (60%) who survived their episode of melioidosis and had confirmed diabetes and 148 patients (40%) who were hyperglycemic at presentation but died of melioidosis before the presence of diabetes could be investigated. Table 2 shows the average annual incidence rate of melioidosis by age, sex, and presence of diabetes. Melioidosis was more common in males, and incidence was highest in the 55- to 64-year age group. Crude and adjusted rate ratios (RR) were calculated for gender, age, and diabetes (Table 3). Male sex, age ≥ 45 years, and both known and undiagnosed diabetes were independent risk factors for melioidosis. Known and undiagnosed diabetes were associated with an adjusted RR of 12.4 and 7.8, respectively, compared with no diabetes (P < 0.001)."
1477397,2,"Deaths from melioidosis. Death occurred in 956 of 2,243 patients, and the average mortality rate over the study period was 42.6% (Table 1). There was a decrease in mortality rate over time from 49% in 1997 to 40.5% in 2006 (P = 0.006; χ2 test for trend). The average mortality rate from melioidosis was calculated for the province as 5.41 per 100,000 people per year. Figure 1 shows a comparison between these data and national population mortality rates attributed to other infectious diseases. If national data for deaths from infectious diseases are representative for Ubon Ratchathani province, melioidosis was the third most common cause of death from an infectious disease over the study period after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and tuberculosis. In 2006, the population mortality rate attributed to melioidosis was comparable with the mortality rate attributed to tuberculosis (8.64 [95% CI = 7.33–10.11] versus 8.30 per 100,000 people per year, respectively)."
1477242,0,"A total of 44,426 blood culture samples were collected from patients during January 2009 to December 2013 in Nakhon Phanom province. Of these, 2,528 (5.7%) cultures from 2,031 patients had a presumed pathogen isolated. A total of 631 B. pseudomallei isolates from 575 patients were identified; after excluding 11 outpatients and 56 patients with multiple positive cultures, 564 hospitalized bacteremic melioidosis patients were included in the analysis. Among these 564 patients with bacteremic melioidosis, 313 (56%) had ALRI and were also captured by the pneumonia surveillance system (Figure 1)."
1477242,1,"Incidence of hospitalized bacteremic melioidosis. The overall incidence rate of bacteremic melioidosis hospitalizations in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, during 2009–2013 was 14.9 per 100,000 persons per year. Annual incidence ranged from 13.7 per 100,000 persons in 2009 to 17.2 per 100,000 persons in 2010 (Table 1). Males comprised 60% of hospitalized bacteremic melioidosis patients and the overall incidence rate was higher in males than females (Table 1). During the investigation period, bacteremic melioidosis occurred in patients aged 1 to 93 years old; median age was 53 years (interquartile range 43–62 years), and 22 (4%) bacteremic melioidosis patients were younger than 15 years old. The highest incidence was observed among patients aged 55–64 years at 46.9 per 100,000 persons per year (95% CI; 39.9–54.8) (Table 1). Age-specific incidence rate by year is shown in Figure 2. The number of bacteremic melioidosis cases was significantly higher in the rainy season, 304 cases in July–October with a peak in August (19%) compared with the dry season, 121 cases in March–June (P-value = 0.037)."
1477242,2,"Of 313 bacteremic melioidosis patients with ALRI, 202 (65%) had a CXR performed within 48 hours after admission, and 92 (29%) had radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Therefore, among all 564 bacteremic melioidosis case patients, 92 (16%) had pneumonia. The incidence rate of hospitalized bacteremic melioidosis with pneumonia was 2.4 per 100,000 persons per year (95% CI; 1.9–2.9). Among bacteremic melioidosis patients with pneumonia, the most common clinical characteristics were rales or crepitation (84%), fever > 38°C (74%), cough (66%), and dyspnea (66%); 74% required oxygen supplementation."
1477242,3,"Among the 564 hospitalized bacteremic melioidosis patients, 52% (294) were admitted in community hospitals and 48% (270) in a provincial hospital. Patients admitted in the provincial hospital were more likely to have severe respiratory illness as demonstrated by 40% requiring intubation (54/138) compared with 11% (20/175) of patients admitted to community hospitals, P-value < 0.001. We observed differences in the prevalence of the following clinical measures between bacteremic melioidosis patients with ALRI admitted to the provincial hospital compared with those admitted to community hospitals: dyspnea (62% versus 28%), tachypnea (43% versus 21%), wheezing (24% versus 43%), confusion (21% versus 9%), oxygen therapy (64% versus 49%), intubation (39% versus 10%), abnormal white blood cell count (60% versus 43%), and comorbidity of renal disease (41% versus 26%) and liver disease (19% versus 3%); P-value < 0.05."
1477242,4,"Deaths among hospitalized bacteremic melioidosis. In-hospital death occurred in 79 (14%) of 564 bacteremic melioidosis patients. Most (50/79) deaths occurred within 2 days after admission. Median duration of hospital stay before death was 2 days with a range of 1–21 days. The in-hospital fatality rate declined from 15% in 2009 to 13% in 2013 (slope of regression; −0.5%, 95% CI; −1.1–0.03%, Figure 3A). The in-hospital fatality rate among bacteremic melioidosis patients was highest in November at 19% (8/43) compared with the month with the highest number of cases in August 13% (14/106). The overall population mortality rate was 2.1 per 100,000 persons per year (95% CI; 1.7–2.6) and slightly decreased from 2.7 per 100,000 persons per year (95% CI; 1.6–4.1) in 2010 to 2.0 per 100,000 persons per year (95% CI; 1.1–3.3) in 2013. The observed in-hospital fatality rate among bacteremic melioidosis pneumonia patients significantly decreased from 33% (6/18) in 2009–5% (1/20) in 2013 (P-value = 0.006) (Figure 3B). Thirty-nine (42%) melioidosis pneumonia patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated, of whom 51% (20/39) died in the hospital and 41% (16/39) were discharged in poor condition. In-hospital mortality rate among patients admitted to the provincial hospital was higher than that among cases admitted to community hospitals (33% [67/206] versus 7% [12/173], P-value < 0.001)."
1477242,5,"Potentially poor clinical outcome at the time of discharge was observed at 32% (178/564) of bacteremic melioidosis patients, including 139 (25%) who transferred to another hospital, 22 (4%) discharged against advice, and 17 (3%) escaped (Table 2). Outcome status was listed as poor condition in 47% (34/72) of bacteremic melioidosis patients with pneumonia compared with 35% (144/413) of non-pneumonia cases (P-value = 0.045). Given the high percentage of patients with potentially poor clinical outcome at the time of discharge, we performed a sensitivity analysis to account for a range of overall death rate among patients discharged in poor condition. The overall death rate ranged from 14% to 46%; 22% to 59% among patients with pneumonia; and 13% to 43% among non-pneumonia patients. Patients who had poor clinical outcome at discharge were more likely to have dyspnea (48% versus 31%), abnormal breath (40% versus 24%), tachypnea (36% versus 23%), oxygen therapy (71% versus 37%), intubation (30% versus 4%), and confusion (19% versus 8%) compared with survivors; P-value < 0.05."
1477242,6,"Drug susceptibility. Among 513 B. pseudomallei isolates tested since 2010, 99.8% were susceptible to ceftazidime and 95.8% were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. No clear trend in resistance patterns during the study period was observed."
429616,0,"A total of 30 patient samples classified as cases of melioidosis were analyzed of which 23 were confirmed cases (culture positive) and 7 were probable cases (high antibody titre positive). Among the 23 confirmed cases of melioidosis, 18 were classified as septicaemic or bacteriaemic. A total of 27 identified positive cases had comorbidities such as diabetes, alcoholism, kidney disease etc. Healthy volunteers and cases of sepsis (negative for B. pseudomallei) of 10 each, were also profiled as negative controls for the study."
429616,1,"We analyzed our data based on duration of clinical symptoms, duration of antibiotics and associated comorbidities as these listed factors play a confounding role in host gene expression during infection. Such an analysis was needed to understand host gene expression during early and late acute phases of infection and disease severity in susceptible groups."
429616,2,"Interestingly, we did not find significant differential expression of immune response genes and epigenetic modifiers in melioidosis patients compared to healthy controls. Cases of sepsis due to other infections, on the other hand, showed statistically significant differential gene expression from the melioidosis patients for most of the genes investigated."
429616,3,"Gene expression profile of cytokines. mRNA expression levels of IL18, CCL5 and IL12 in PBMC’s were low in all the samples. IL8, IL15 and HMGB1 were significantly up regulated in other sepsis cases compared to healthy controls (Table 2, Fig 1)."
429616,4,"IL6, IL8, IFNγ, TNFα, IL1β and IL15 did not show any statistically significant differential gene expression in melioidosis samples compared to sepsis cases. IL4 showed significant up regulation in melioidosis cases compared to other sepsis cases (Table 2, Fig 1) while HMGB1, an inflammatory mediator was consistently down regulated in melioidosis cases compared to other sepsis cases, irrespective of all other factors like comorbidities, duration of fever/clinical symptoms and antibiotic treatment (Tables ​(Tables22–5, Figs ​Figs11–3)."
429616,5,"Septicaemic melioidosis patients showed a similar expression pattern as above, in addition to IL8 being down regulated compared to other sepsis cases (Table 3, Fig 1). IL8 down regulation was also seen in early acute melioidosis cases with less than 15 days of fever/clinical symptoms and antibiotic treatment. (Table 3, Fig 2). Melioidosis patients with regular alcohol consumption habits also expressed significant down regulation of IL8 compared to other sepsis cases (Table 5, Fig 3)."
429616,6,"Gene expression profile of Toll-like receptors (TLR’s). TLR2 and TLR4 were significantly up regulated in sepsis caused by other pathogens compared to healthy controls. Melioidosis patients showed significantly down regulated expression of TLR4 while both TLR2 and TLR4 was down regulated in septicaemic melioidosis cases compared to sepsis caused by other pathogens (Table 2, Fig 1)."
429616,7,"Gene expression profile of genes associated with the antigen presentation pathway and cell-mediated immunity. MICB, PSMB2, PSMB8 and PSME2 were significantly up regulated in other sepsis cases compared to healthy controls while these target genes showed no significant differential expression in patients suffering from melioidosis compared to healthy controls. Therefore, the expression of these genes can be considered as down regulated in the melioidosis cohort including septicaemic melioidosis cases compared to other sepsis cases (Tables ​(Tables22 and ​and3,3, Fig 1). This differential expression between melioidosis cases compared to sepsis controls was seen consistently, irrespective of other factors like duration of fever/clinical symptoms, antibiotic treatment and associated comorbidities (Tables ​(Tables22–5, Figs ​Figs11–3)."
429616,8,"Gene expression profile of epigenetic modification factors. DNMT3B, HDAC1 and HDAC2 were significantly up regulated in other sepsis cases compared to healthy controls (Table 2, Fig 1). These epigenetic markers were significantly down regulated in melioidosis including septicaemic melioidosis cases compared to other sepsis cases (Tables ​(Tables22 and ​and3,3, Fig 1). Our results also showed a consistent differential expression pattern of these epigenetic factors irrespective of other factors like duration of fever/clinical symptoms, antibiotic treatment and associated comorbidities (risk factors) (Tables ​(Tables22–5, Figs ​Figs11–3). Melioidosis patients with a regular alcohol consumption habit also expressed significant down regulation of DNMT3A, apart from a similar differential expression of other markers compared to other sepsis cases (Table 5, Fig 3)."
1807783,0,"Figure 1 shows the configuration of parameter estimates for reduction in CFR and percentage of melioidosis-confirmed cases in which each strategy is cost-effective. In a scenario where 20% of empirically treated patients are culture-confirmed melioidosis, meropenem would be cost-effective as an empirical treatment for patients with suspected severe melioidosis (Plan B) and for all suspected melioidosis patients (Plan C) if meropenem reduced mortality by at least 9% (absolute reduction from 70% to at least 64%) and at least 30% (absolute reduction from 40% to at least 28%), respectively (Figure 1, Scenario 1). This proportion of culture-confirmation is a reasonable estimate for routine practice in northeast Thailand."
1807783,1,"In a scenario where over 50% of empirically treated patients are culture-confirmed melioidosis, (Plan B) would be cost-effective with a reduction in CFR of 5% and (Plan C) with a reduction of at least 14%, respectively (Figure 1, Scenario 2). Such a high proportion of culture-confirmation has been reported in the context of clinical trials, however, this is unlikely to be representative of routine care."
428872,0,"Patient characteristics. We recruited 52 controls and 34 culture-confirmed melioidosis patients at Sappasithiprasong Hospital in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. All patients were septic (see inclusion criteria) and had diabetes. Controls were, therefore, otherwise healthy diabetics attending a routine out-patient diabetes clinic. Their baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1 and their laboratory findings are depicted in S1 Table. This cohort has been previously described elsewhere [9]. In the melioidosis group, 12 patients died (35%) before the first follow up (≥28 days after enrolment)."
428872,1,"Melioidosis is associated with thrombocytopenia. An important function of VWF is to mediate platelet-platelet interactions and platelet adhesion to sub-endothelial collagen and is associated with platelet consumption and thrombocytopenia [13–15]. The median platelet count in patients with melioidosis was 189 × 109/l compared to 299 × 109/l in controls (p = 0.0001, Fig 1A). There were 14 melioidosis patients (41%) with thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count <150 × 109/l) and no cases of thrombocytopenia among controls (p<0.0001). Among patients, the lowest admission platelet count observed was 13 × 109/l. Platelet counts were lower in non-survivors (median 138 × 109/l) compared to survivors (247 × 109/l, p = 0.02, Fig 1B). Of the 12 patients who died, eight (67%) had thrombocytopenia compared to six of the survivors (27%, p = 0.04)."
428872,2,"VWF levels are elevated in melioidosis. Having seen thrombocytopenia in acute melioidosis, we predicted that this would be driven by high levels of circulating VWF. We observed that VWF antigen levels were higher in patients (geometric mean, 478 U/dl) compared to controls (166 U/dL, p<0.0001, Fig 2A). However, the level of VWF antigen at recruitment was not associated with mortality (geometric mean 445 U/dL in survivors versus 540 U/dL in non-survivors, p = 0.08, Fig 2B)."
428872,3,"Excess circulating VWF in melioidosis is driven by excess secretion. Next, we looked at whether the excess VWF antigen might be explained by increased secretion. VWF propeptide is a marker for recent secretion of VWF from the Weibel-Palade bodies (WBD) of endothelial cells and the dense granules of platelets [29]. We found VWF propeptide concentrations were higher in patients (460 U/dL) compared to controls (159 U/dL, p<0.0001, Fig 3A). Furthermore, VWF propeptide levels correlated well with VWF antigen levels (Pearson’s r = 0.54, p = 0.003, Fig 3B), supporting our hypothesis that the excess in circulating VWF was due to excess secretion of VWF. VWF propeptide concentration and survival were not correlated, and the range of values obtained in non-survivors fell within the range obtained for survivors (p = 0.21, Fig 3C)."
428872,4,"Excess circulating VWF antigen is also driven by reduced ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13 is a metalloprotease secreted by the liver known as VWF cleaving protease [14, 17]. Deficiencies of ADAMTS13 results in the accumulation of VWF in the circulation and, consequently, thrombocytopenia [13, 14]. Previous studies have found an association between sepsis and reduced levels of ADAMTS13 [30, 31]. The mean ADAMTS13 concentration was 31 U/dL in patients and 90 U/dL in controls (p<0.0001, Fig 4A). ADAMTS13 levels and VWF antigen were negatively correlated (r = 0.53, p = 0.002, Fig 4B), which supports our hypothesis that decreased levels of ADAMTS13 contribute to high concentrations of VWF in melioidosis. However, there was only weak evidence for an inverse correlation between ADAMTS13 deficiency and mortality in melioidosis (p = 0.05, Fig 4C). Although the mean ADAMTS13 level in non-survivors (26 U/dL) was lower than that in survivors (34 U/dL), the range of values obtained in non-survivors (14 to 43 U/dL) fell entirely within the range of values obtained in survivors (11 to 57 U/dL)."
428872,5,"VWF is not the main driver of thrombocytopenia in melioidosis. Thrombocytopenia was a feature of acute melioidosis and correlates with mortality. We also found high levels of VWF in melioidosis, which were both explained by increased secretion of pre-formed VWF and by reduced clearance of VWF. However, if VWF were the main driver of thrombocytopenia in melioidosis, then it is surprising that VWF antigen, VWF propeptide and ADAMTS13 levels do not correlate with mortality. We therefore re-examined the relationship between VWF antigen levels and platelet count, and found that although both were deranged in melioidosis, their levels were not correlated (r = 0.28, p = 0.12, S1 Fig)."
428872,6,"Platelet counts, VWF antigen and ADAMTS13 return to normal following recovery from melioidosis. In those patients who survived, a follow-up sample was taken seven days following enrollment and at the first follow-up clinic (≥28 days after discharge). In all patients, perturbations of platelet counts as well as abnormalities in levels of VWF antigen, VWF propeptide and ADAMTS13 all resolved completely following recovery from melioidosis (S2A–S2D Fig)."
432177,0,"We identified 1170 articles from the bibliographic databases search (PubMed, Web of Science and Thai-Journal Citation Index) including Google Scholar, as well as 82 articles from the grey literature sources. After removal of duplicates, the remaining 1091 records were then assessed for the eligibility through abstracts and full texts. We excluded 1021 studies for particular reasons, and the rest of the 70 studies were sought for the individual participant data. We found 69 studies with 159 subjects for which individual participant data were provided. However, nine individual patients were excluded because the participants duplicate others."
432177,1,"Moreover, we excluded the additional 42 cases because the diagnosis was not CNS melioidosis. Finally, we recruited 69 reports including 108 subjects for which individual participant data were provided. For another study that individual participant data were not provided, the aggregate data of 12 participants were available. In total, we recruited 70 studies with 120 patients for the analysis (Fig 1). The first report of a CNS melioidosis patient was presented in 1977. The number of patients per publication ranged from 1 to 12 cases."
432177,2,"The characteristics of the included studies and individual patients are summarized in the S1 Table. Most cases (93%) were reported from the endemic area of melioidosis in which Australia, Thailand, India, and Malaysia accounted for a majority of patients (Fig 2). Ninety-three percent of Australian patients were reported from the northern part, while 65% of Thai cases were from the northeastern region. Eight cases (7%) were reported from the non-endemic countries including the USA, Belgium, Japan, Norway, and UAE. These patients traveled, lived or served as a soldier in the endemic region at some points of time before the disease development. Fifteen cases worked as rice farmers. Three patients reported the histories of preceding cranial injuries."
432177,3,"The median age of the CNS melioidosis patients was 40 years (IQR 18–53). The 10-day newborn was the youngest reported case, while the oldest was 75 years of age. Most patients (77%) were adults (≥19 years), and 70% of patients were men. Risk factors for melioidosis were shown in Table 1. Most patients (60%) had one or more risk factors. Diabetes mellitus was the most common (43%), but in Australia, excessive alcohol use is the most prominent risk factor (39%). Five cases from Australia were reportedly heavy drinkers of kava, a drink prepared from the powder of the root plant Piper methysticum. Contrary to adult patients, most pediatric cases (67%) did not have any risk factors for melioidosis. However, diabetes mellitus remained the only risk factor among children."
432177,4,"The median duration from clinical onset to diagnosis was ten days (IQR 5–25), and it ranged from 1 to 150 days. Majority of CNS melioidosis patients (91%) was classified as acute melioidosis (less than two months of onset). Encephalomyelitis (37%) and brain abscess (35%) were the two most common disease types. Regarding the age group, encephalomyelitis was most observed in the adult (39%), while brain abscess was the most common type in the children (44%). The cases of encephalomyelitis were reported mainly from Australia (63%). Other types of CNS melioidosis included isolated meningitis and isolated extra-axial collection, which accounted for 16 and 12 percent of cases, respectively. Clinical manifestations of all CNS melioidosis and its types are described in Table 2. Fever was the top presentation for all CNS melioidosis, while other features included headache, altered consciousness, neck stiffness, seizures, unilateral weakness, paraplegia, quadriplegia, and cranial nerve palsies. The facial nerve was the most common cranial nerve affected. In encephalomyelitis patients, the fever and cranial nerve deficits were the prominent manifestations. In brain abscess cases, the most common presentations were the fever and unilateral weakness. Fifteen cases were reported to present with craniofacial swelling. Sixty-seven percent of patients had one or more extraneurological involvement. More than half of those had a pulmonary infection, while one-fourth had localized skin infection (Table 3)."
432177,5,"Fifty-eight cases underwent lumbar puncture. The CSF profile showed pleocytosis in 91% of the cases, and 64% of patients had CSF mononuclear cell predominance. The CSF WBC count had a median of 190 cells/μL (IQR 54–413), while no CSF RBC was detected in 78% of patients. CSF protein was high (>0.45 g/L) in 93% of cases, and the median protein value was 1.16 g/L (IQR 0.82–1.64). CSF glucose was low (<2.2 mmol/L) in 34% of patients, and the mean glucose level was 2.8 mmol/L (SD 1.5)."
432177,6,"Both CT and MRI of the brain were equally done (60% vs. 58% of cases). However, 33% of patients who did the brain CT initially had a normal imaging result, while the brain MRI findings were abnormal in all cases. The imaging findings included hyperintensity on T2W in all MRI cases and also brain edema in 97% of CT and MRI results. There were 49 patients of encephalomyelitis and brain abscess reported having the abnormal contrast enhancement in neuroimaging which the rim-enhancing pattern was the most common characteristic (78%). Other features included nodular (14%), irregular (14%), leptomeningeal (14%) and linear enhancement (2%). Brainstem (34%), frontal lobe (34%) and parietal lobe (33%) were among the most common locations affected in the encephalomyelitis and brain abscess patients (Table 1). Lesions involving contiguous parts of the CNS, which included supra- and infratentorial brain as well as spinal cord, occurs in 29 percent of encephalomyelitis cases. Skull and scalp lesions were present in 19% and 16% of cases, respectively. Twenty-two percent of patients having brain parenchymal diseases also had concurrent involvement of adjacent parts encompassing extra-axial spaces, skull or extracranial structures."
432177,7,"The diagnosis of melioidosis was confirmed with the positive culture in 110 CNS melioidosis patients (92%). Blood was the most common specimen (41%) that grew the organism. Positive cultures of the CNS specimens, which includes brain tissue or pus, CSF and extra-axial collection, were present in 32, 21 and 10 cases, respectively (Table 4). Nine patients (8%) depended on only the serology for diagnosis, which the antibody titer ranged from 1:16 to 1:1,280. There was one case that was diagnosed by only polymerase chain reaction test of blood buffy coat."
432177,8,"Ceftazidime (54% of cases), meropenem (36%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX, 41%) were the primary drugs used for intensive-phase therapy. Others included chloramphenicol (13%), imipenem (7%) and doxycycline (5%) (Table 1). Eight or more weeks of recommended treatment duration was reported in 30 percent of non-death cases. For eradication phase, TMP/SMX was the most common prescription (73%) among others that encompassed doxycycline (27%) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (12%). The treatment duration of at least six months was given in 24 percent of non-death patients. Adjunctive abscess drainage was performed in 58 percent of cases. After treatment, 37 percent of the CNS melioidosis patients recovered completely or nearly completely. Thirty-one percent had moderate neurological improvement, while 13 percent did not recover and suffered neurological disability. Overall mortality was 20 percent of patients."
1974798,0,"Our synthesis of evidence from 12 observational studies indicates that diabetes is the risk factor for melioidosis with the highest relative risk, followed by age over 45 years and chronic renal disease (Table 1). In the regional analysis, vaccinating diabetics aged over 45 years living in environmentally suitable areas for melioidosis (Vac 2) would be cost-effective in EAP, SAF and SOA (Fig. 2; see Additional file 1: Table S4 and Figure S2 for detailed results). However, those vaccination strategies would not be cost-effective in LAC and MENA. In the country/territory-level analysis, vaccinating diabetics aged over 45 years (Vac 2) is a cost-effective strategy in 45 geographies. Of these, vaccinating individuals aged over 45 years with either diabetes or chronic renal diseases (Vac 3) is the optimum strategy in six geographies, while vaccinating everyone aged over 45 years with or without diabetes/chronic renal disease (Vac 4) is optimal in ten geographies (Additional file 1: Table S5). However, in 22 geographies, none of the strategies tested (Vac 1-Vac 4) are cost-effective (Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating the diabetic population aged over 45 years (Vac 2) in each geography, as a ratio of GDP per capita."
1974798,1,"Of 5.47 billion people across the 83 evaluated geographies, 1.55 billion are predicted to live in environmentally suitable areas for melioidosis transmission [3]. Of these, 457 million are > 45 years old. If the optimal cost-effective strategy in Additional file 1: Table S5 was applied in each of the 61 geographies where one of the vaccine strategies was found to be cost-effective, 5.26 million people would be vaccinated per year, averting on average 69,000 lost QALYs, 8400 cases and 4500 deaths (i.e. 5.09% reduction in total burden) per vaccinated age cohort. Vaccination would cost USD62.1 million per year but save USD2.47 million in treatment costs. The regions in order of the magnitude of projected reductions in cases are EAP, SOA, SAF, LAC and MENA (with reductions in total burden of 6.72%, 5.30%, 3.87%, 3.58% and 1.99% respectively)."
1974798,2,"Alternatively, if everyone aged 46 living in an environmentally suitability area was vaccinated (Vac 4), then 15.18 million people would be vaccinated per year. This could potentially prevent 13,628 cases of melioidosis and 7386 deaths (9.4% reduction) with a gain of 113,407 QALYs per vaccinated age cohort. If the cost of vaccination was not fixed, then under this scenario the threshold cost of vaccination (averaged across all countries) would be USD18.54, giving a potential market size of USD281.32 million per year (ignoring vaccine distribution costs)."
1974798,3,"A sensitivity analysis showed that with only 50% vaccine protection, vaccinating diabetics aged over 45 years (Vac 2) is a cost-effective strategy in 43 geographies. In addition, vaccinating individuals aged over 45 years with diabetes and/or chronic renal disease (Vac 3) is the optimum strategy in three geographies, while vaccinating everyone aged over 45 years with or without diabetes/chronic renal disease (Vac 4) is optimal in five geographies. In 32 geopraphies, none of the strategies tested (Vac 1-Vac 4) are cost-effective (Additional file 1: Figure S3(a-g) and Table S6). If the optimal cost-effective strategy was applied in each of the 51 geographies, 3.55 million people would be vaccinated per year, averting on average 35,370 lost QALYs, 4311 cases and 2332 deaths (2.61% reduction) per vaccinated age cohort."
