1904820;1;RDTs are generally useful for diagnosing malaria infection [3 5]. However, the sensitivity of RDTs depends upon the species of malaria parasite. The highest sensitivity was observed for P. falciparum malaria (78.8 99.1%) [5, 11, 15 18], followed by P. vivax malaria (77.6 96%), P. ovale malaria (18.4 80.0%), and P. malariae malaria (21.4 47.0%) [3 5, 19, 20]. For non-falciparum malaria, RDT sensitivity was particularly low for P. ovale and P. malariae, a finding that may be attributable to the low parasitemia [3 5], the difference in targeted antigens [6, 9, 10], or the genetic variability between the infected parasites [21, 22].
1904820;2;Low parasitemia was associated with false-negative results from the RDTs regardless of malaria species [4, 5]. Moreover, since reinfection and semi-immune status generally cause low parasitemia [23], those influences need to be eliminated. Travellers who visiting families and relatives and expatriates living in malaria endemic areas were excluded from our study because they were at a higher risk of reinfection. The parasitemia in P. ovale malaria was consequently as low as that in immune patients and was significantly lower than that in P. vivax malaria. This finding, along with those in previous reports [23], suggests that P. ovale malaria presents with low parasitemia even in non-immune travellers, which may result in false-negative results from the RDTs. As mentioned above, P. malariae and P. ovale malaria may be difficult to diagnose by RDTs due to the low parasitemia [7, 8, 11]. Recently, Houz  et al. [24] reported that the new RDT, Clearview, has improved sensitivity for P. malariae malaria but that the sensitivity for P. ovale malaria was not improved. Moreover, even a case of P. ovale malaria with relatively high parasitemia (21,150 parasites/?L) resulted in a false-negative RDT result in their study, implying some reason for false-negative results other than low parasitemia in P. ovale malaria. The difference in target antigens from parasites, such as HRP2 and PfLDH for P. falciparum or pLDH and aldolase for pan-malaria species, can also influence the sensitivity of RDTs [6]. Detecting P. ovale and P. vivax, two RDTs (BN for aldolase detection and SDMA for pLDH detection) were used in our study. SDMA showed relatively good sensitivity for both P. vivax and P. ovale as compared to BN, probably because pLDH-based RDTs generally perform better than aldolase-based RDTs [20]. Bigaillon et al. [6] also reported the ineffectiveness of BN in detecting P. ovale malaria, which they suggested was due to low aldolase production by P. ovale malaria [10]. Aldolase-based RDTs generally show low sensitivity not only for P. ovale malaria but also for other types of malaria [9], but low sensitivity was also observed for pLDH-based RDTs [10 12, 16, 17, 24]. Although the genetic variability of HRP2 was related to the low sensitivity of RDTs for P. falciparum malaria [21], it was reported that the genetic variability of pLDH [22] and aldolase [25, 26] did not explain the relatively poor performance of RDTs for the detection of P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae. Talman et al. [22] reported that P. ovale exhibited three different types of amino acid sequence (named O1, O2 and O3), whichmay contribute to the relatively poor detection of P. ovale. The sensitivity of RDTs is still insufficient for accurate diagnosis of P. ovale malaria regardless of the type of antigens. Therefore, microscopic examination is preferable for the definitive diagnosis of P. ovale malaria. The sensitivity of RDTs was not high enough to accurately diagnose P. ovale malaria in Japanese travellers who were never infected with malaria previously. Thus, microscopic examination is required to ensure that P. ovale malaria is not overlooked.
359836;1;This analysis applied 18-month follow-up data from a Phase III clinical trial to estimate the potential public health impact of the RTS,S candidate malaria vaccine in 42 malaria-endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa using a cohort model. Two vaccination strategies were considered, with doses administered either at 6, 10 and 14 weeks (corresponding to adding the RTS,S vaccine to the EPI schedule) or at 6, 7-and-a-half and 9 months. Each strategy was compared with no vaccination to estimate the expected impact of RTS,S vaccination on averting clinical malaria cases, severe cases, malaria hospitalizations and malaria deaths in a birth cohort followed to the age of 10 years. Vaccination at age 6, 10 and 14 weeks would be expected to avert over five million cases of clinical malaria, 119,000 severe malaria cases, 98,600 malaria hospitalizations and 31,000 malaria deaths. Vaccination at age 6, 7-and-a-half and 9 months would be expected to avert almost 12.5 million cases of clinical malaria, 250,000 severe malaria cases, 208,000 malaria hospitalizations and 65,400 malaria deaths. The wide CIs reflect the combination of heterogeneity and uncertainty allowed for by the stochastic process in the model. The greatest uncertainty is around the impact on mortality.
359836;2;After calibration, the model-predicted results closely matched the incidence of malaria observed in the control arm of the Phase III trial, and the published age distribution of malaria cases [14]. However, when extrapolating at the country level, the modelled estimates for the number of clinical malaria cases and malaria deaths were larger than the estimates for 2010 in the WHO World Malaria Report 2012, which estimated the number of clinical malaria cases in the WHO Africa region in all age groups at 174 million (upper bound 242 million), and the number of malaria deaths at 596,000 (upper bound 772,000) [26]. Possible reasons for the differences are The model is calibrated to the incidence of clinical malaria in the control arm of the Phase III trial based on the secondary case definition (parasite density of >0 and presence of fever). It may be possible that the secondary case definition would have captured cases of fever due to other illnesses and the malaria parasites observed were present as a co-morbidity rather than the primary cause. The primary case definition (parasite density of >5000 and presence of fever) would be more specific and lead to a reduction of estimates by 35 %. Estimated malaria episodes from WHO World Malaria report may not sufficiently adjust for under-reporting, although a correction factor is used; The model estimated malaria incidence based on reported proportion of children within categories of parasite prevalence from the MAP project. If this proportion varies over the year or the force of infection varies within a category, this is not captured by the model. Finally, the case-fatality rate for severe cases not treated in hospital is subject to a large uncertainty. An estimate from Thwing et al. [22] is applied in the model but this factor has a large impact on malaria mortality estimates (see Fig. 5a, b). However it should be noted that clinical vaccine efficacy does not change with the primary or secondary case definition.
359836;3;Obtaining a realistic estimate of the number of severe malaria cases and malaria hospitalizations is important as these outcomes contribute to understanding the health burden of malaria. However, available data are limited and generally relate to populations with access to treatment. For example, the Phase III trial was conducted in settings where all patients had access to a high level of care. It was found that about half of the patients hospitalized with malaria met the case definition for severe malaria (parasite density <5000), which is similar to the value reported in a study of hospitalized patients in Tanzania, where 4261 patients of the 9337 with positive blood slides had severe disease (46 %) [20]. However, neither of these studies could provide data on the fraction of severe malaria cases that did not result in hospitalization, or on the risk of severe malaria developing in patients without access to treatment. The present analysis attempted to adjust for limited access to prompt and high-quality treatment for uncomplicated cases and limited access to hospitalization for severe cases.
2052982;1;A rapid diagnostic test based on the detection of P. falciparum specific HRP-2 antigen is one of the few diagnostic tools available for health care workers in many resource limited settings in malaria endemic settings to assist them in differentiating between malaria fever and other causes of fever in many malaria. As previously reported, HRP-2 based RDTs displayed a low specificity (59%) in the current study area [18]. This low specificity of HRP2 based RDT was also reported in other malaria endemic areas [13, 26,27,28]. Therefore, expert microscopy was performed in the present study in the central laboratory of CRUN to further determine (by cross-checking) whether antimicrobials were appropriately prescribed by the attending health care staff. Despite the good attitude of health care workers to nearly always use malaria RDT in case of a febrile patient and act accordingly to the result of diagnostic testing (92.89 of adherence of health care workers to malaria RDT), the prescription of antimalarials is affected by the performance of the malaria RDT used in the study area [23]. Due to the persistence of HRP2 antigen after successful antimalarial treatment, malaria infection is overestimated (as a result of a false positive RDT) leading to an inappropriate prescription of antimalarials [13,14,15,16]. Furthermore, even if the diagnosis malaria was established by RDT, there was a tendency to prescribe antibiotics next to antimalarials too. Moreover, and even worse, the prescription of antibiotics becomes almost systematic when a malaria infection could be excluded. The majority of outpatients were visiting the rural health facilities where there is a lack of laboratory facilities that can confirm the actual cause of infection and this explains the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics at this level. In contrast, at the level of the referral hospital these facilities are available, but there the attending hospital health care workers might not feel confident to postpone antibiotic treatments in febrile children until the microbiology results become available in fear of treating a potentially life threating, but treatable, bacterial infection too late or overlooking such an infection. Given the fact that health care workers tend to adhere well to malaria RDT results as reported in our study area [this study and previous study by Ruizendaal et al. [29], it is most probable that health system may be able to deal with the problem of inappropriate prescription of antibiotics as long as the health care workers get the appropriate diagnostic tools. Therefore, the development of (near) point-of-care tests to screen for other causes of fever becomes essential to guide appropriate antibiotic prescriptions.
2052982;2;The inappropriate prescription of antibiotics and antimalarial treatments observed in the present study could be a consequence of the rightful fear of health care workers to miss a treatable bacterial infection. Indeed, a significant number of potentially treatable etiologies were missed in the present study and others [18, 30]. Despite the tendency of systematic prescription of antibiotics to febrile children, an important number of children with bacterial infections did not receive appropriate treatment mainly at the referral hospital at the first contact compared to the rural health facilities. This observation can be explained by the availability at referral hospital of equipped laboratory allowing for a better diagnostic compared to health facilities where malaria RDT is the only diagnostic tool available. Moreover, in Burkina Faso, nurses working at health facilities are responsible for the primary management of patients, while at the referral hospital there are medical doctors who are better trained to make a specific prescription. The fear to overlook a potential bacterial infection by sending a sick child back home without prescribing medication leads to the antibiotic prescriptions to an important part of febrile children without bacterial infections. This tendency of systematic prescription of antibiotics to febrile children is considered in many setting to be more a social and behavioral issue than a medical problem [31]. To tackle this problem, there is a need to evaluate and understand the context in which the (over) prescriptions occur. Moreover, more diagnostic tools should become available that can be implemented in resource limited settings that can aid proper antibiotics prescriptions and thereby reducing the risk of inappropriate prescription and of emerging of antibiotic resistance. Antiparasitics drugs were not much prescribed in this study. Based on the laboratory findings, there was a high under-prescription of antiparasitics as actually a significant number of febrile children who actually had gastro-intestinal parasites did not receive appropriate treatment. Most likely, the more obscure symptoms associated with a parasitic gastro-intestinal infection, which in most cases do not cause fever, are probably overlooked in favor of other febrile etiologies that are more readily diagnosed.
2052982;3;Despite the recommendation of the WHO to treat all children with a positive malaria RDT or microscopy result, few cases (4.52%) of febrile children who had a malaria positive RDT did not receive antimalarials. The reason for this non adherence was not assessed in the present study. Possibly, complementary information on previous drug use provided by the parents/guardians to the attending nurses suggested that these children did not require antimalarial prescriptions and that the RDT were positive in these cases was interpreted as a consequence of persisting HRP2 antigen (up to 4 weeks or even more) after successful treatment for malaria [13,14,15,16]. In contrast, 14% of the children with a malaria RDT negative result still received antimalarial prescriptions. It has not been determined in the present study what the rationale was behind this non-compliance. This lack of adherence to the protocols in place for the management of malaria has also been reported elsewhere [32]. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to further study the motivation of health care workers to not adhere to this protocol recommended by the WHO and the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) and this should preferably be done, in combination with to further training and education of the health practitioners. A possible limitation of our study could be the lack of confirmation of pneumonia cases presumptively diagnosed by health care workers. Although the nasopharynx of some children was colonized by common bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, a relation of their presence with ongoing fever has not been established [22]. Therefore, it might be possible that some of these children did not have pneumonia. Moreover, RTI are the second cause of fever diagnosed presumptively by health facility nurses after malaria in the present study. The WHO guideline recommends the prescription of antibiotics to children with (suspected) pneumonia but not to children with acute bronchitis [1, 20, 33, 34]. In the present study, a radiological confirmation of pneumonia could not be done in children suspected of RTI, because this diagnostic technology is was not available at the participating health centres. Another possible limitation of the present research is the potential under-diagnosis of the number of UTI and GII cases as some urine and stool samples were not collected during recruitment. Finally, viral etiologies are known to be responsible for a significant number of fever episodes in children [17, 35, 36], but these were not studied in the present study as the CRUN laboratory does not have facilities to perform virus identification. Although viral febrile infections do not need antibiotic treatment, they can also be a cause of over prescriptions as there is fear of overlooking potential bacterial infections. A rapid diagnostic test (or combination of tests) that can broadly differentiate between bacterial and viral infections would be very helpful in this respect [37,38,39].
1904879;1;A prevalence of 27.7% for malaria was observed by microscopy in this study population. This prevalence was similar to the 29.6% reported by Apinjo et al. [28] in children <?15?years of age in the South West Region of Cameroon. On the contrary, higher prevalence of 46.7% and 36.9% in children less than 15?years has been reported in other areas in the Mount Cameroon area [2]. Besides a decline in prevalence, this study also observed a remarkable fall in geometric mean parasite density from 2131 parasites/?L [25] to 187 parasites/?L in this population. Similarly, the proportion of febrile children in this population was 3.4% and has also experienced substantial decrease from 27.1% [25] in Dibanda and 41.9% [34] in different communities of the Mount Cameroon area. The decline in morbidity in the study area is not surprising because recently, Dibanda has been experiencing urban transformation from a farm land site/village setting into a settlement area  new layout.  Various authors have postulated that increased urbanisation reduces the number of breeding places for Anopheles mosquitoes and consequently malaria transmission [35, 36]. Also, in Dibanda, there is a general change in house type from predominantly plank houses [28] to cement block houses which may have played a role in curbing the disease burden. It has been reported that a plank house has crevices for mosquito entry [37] and provides a favourable microenvironment for mosquitoes [38]. In addition, the decrease in malaria morbidity could also be the result of sustained control measures as reported by WHO [2] and Sumbele et al. [4]. Malaria prevalence was higher in females than males by microscopy and the findings are in line with Kimbi et al. [32] who reported that females spend more time outdoors at dusk and dawn than males to perform household chores and as such are more exposed to mosquito bites. It is not surprising that children under 5 years had the highest parasitaemia when compared with the older children. Children under 5 years are more vulnerable to the disease in areas of high transmission [2, 30, 34] as naturally acquired immunity builds up in older children following repeated exposure to the parasite. In line with the findings of Ebai et al. [34] in other parts of the Mount Cameroon area, children from individuals with no formal or with primary education were more infected with the malaria parasite than those with secondary or tertiary education. Higher levels of education are generally associated with improved knowledge and practices in relation to appropriate prevention and treatment strategies. The high prevalence of anaemia (72.7%) in children less than 15?years is not an uncommon finding in this part of the country, and this highlights anaemia as a major public health problem among the population in this area. The relationship between malaria parasitaemia and anaemia is well established in previous studies [2, 30, 39]. However, findings in the area [30] reported a low risk of anaemia attributable to malaria highlighting the insidious and important contribution of other inflammatory infections or diseases which were not investigated in the study.
1904879;2;In the present study, CareStart RDT sensitivity (82.4) and specificity (76.6) did not reach the values indicated by the manufacturer (98% and 97.5%, respectively). The PPV was 57.4%, and the NPV was 91.9%. This could be explained by the difference between populations used to estimate these parameters. In the present study, we evaluated a population with all levels of parasitaemia, whereas the manufacturer s tests were done on samples with a density of >?200 parasites/?L of blood. The results from this study are consistent with similar studies reported in Africa. A study by Wanja et al. [40] in Western Kenya showed that CareStart (G0181, G0131 and G0141) had a sensitivity range of 86.9 95.48%, specificity range of 71.2 81.4%, PPV range of 59.2 72.8 and NPV range of 91.9 97.9. Also, Maltha et al. [41], in a reference setting showed the sensitivity of the CareStart Malaria HRP2/pan kit for the detection of P. falciparum to be 84.8 92.0%. Findings from this study demonstrated a higher CareStart RDT (G0141) performance characteristics when compared with a previous study carried out by Ndamukong-Nyanga [21] in the Mount Cameroon area (sensitivity?=?48.5%, specificity?=?84%, PPV =?62.3% and NPV?=?75.0%) even though their mean parasite density/?L of blood (2333, range 18 16,000) was higher. However, a lower sensitivity in performance could be attributed to a prozone effect which has been reported as a cause of false negative HRP-2 RDT [42]. On the other hand, a study by Maltha et al. [43] in Burkina Faso demonstrated higher sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 100%, 70.9%, 69.4% and 100%, respectively, for PfHRP2 detection. Likewise, a study by Diallo et al. [42] in Senegal demonstrated that CareStart  RDT showed high sensitivity (97.3%) and specificity (94.1%) with PPV and NPV of 97.3 and 94.1%, considering polymerase chain reaction as standard. The higher performance of the HRP2 RDT from these studies was probably due to their study design. Unlike our study which was on non-clinical cases and had as limitation a less sensitive gold standard the Giemsa-stained microscopy when compared with the highly sensitive PCR, these studies were all hospital based and the occurrence of fever was an inclusion criterion. The sensitivity of the RDT in this study increased with an increase in parasite density achieving a sensitivity of 96.1% at parasite density greater than or equal to 200 parasites/?L of blood, as recommended by WHO [17]. This is in line with several studies [40, 41, 44] where the sensitivity increased to >?95% at parasite densities greater than 200 parasites/?L of blood. This finding confirms the inability of RDTs to reliably detect malaria parasites at very low parasite densities. The CareStart RDT was positive for all febrile children with malaria (100%). This study also demonstrated that febrile children were 6.7 times at higher odds to be positive by RDT when compared with afebrile children. A sensitivity of 100% was reported by Maltha et al. [43] among hospitalised febrile children in Burkina Faso. Moreover, studies by Wilson [45] reported that patients with febrile illness in endemic areas are likely to be diagnosed with malaria. While the CareStart RDT could be considered a useful diagnostic tool for ruling out malaria in cases where good Giemsa microscopy is not available or appropriate in the health facility, its applications in communities and population-based screening with a higher proportion of asymptomatic cases are limited. Findings from the study showed a low positive predictive value (57.4%) indicating a high false positive rate. This could probably be due to prior infection and subsequent effective treatment as reported in the structured questionnaires. This study indicated that children who had a history of fever within a month prior to the survey were 4.6 times more likely to be positive by RDT. The HRP2 antigen detected by this RDT has been demonstrated in several studies to persist in the blood stream between 14 and 30?days before being cleared completely [46, 47]. Moreover, as a limitation in the study, rheumatoid factor which was not measured has been suggested to produce false positive due to binding IgG [48]. The relatively high negative predictive value (91.9%) in this study indicates the likelihood of the RDT to correctly identify a child without malaria as true negative, hence showing a substantive ability to differentiate between children who had malaria and those without. Hence, this RDT could be confidently used to confirm negative test patients as non-malaria patients. The false negative results produced by CareStart (G0141) could be accounted for by deletions or mutations of the HRP2 gene such that the parasite no longer produces the antigen or produces the mutant antigen that is not recognised by antibodies on the test strip [22]. This study revealed that children under 5 years were 2 times more likely to be positive for RDT when compared with older children. Similar results with a decrease in sensitivity of the Paracheck-Pf RDT in older age groups have been reported in Tanzania [49]. This is probably because younger children are more vulnerable to the disease and have higher parasite loads when compared with older children. This observation is in line with reports from other studies [2, 50]. Findings in this study also revealed higher odds of having a positive RDT among anaemic than non-anaemic children. This is probably because of the likelihood of anaemic children having Plasmodium infection and a higher parasite load. Malaria has been reported by several authors to contribute substantially to anaemia in malaria-endemic regions [39, 51] and this study attests to this.
544861;1;Majority of the facilities still use syndromic approach in the diagnosis of malaria. This finding is not surprising as this had been previously reported from many endemic countries [6]. Using a syndromic approach in diagnosis of malaria means increased likelihood of unnecessary prescribing of antimalarials [11], because some other febrile illnesses that are not malaria might have been treated as malaria. Also the use of, laboratory diagnosis (RDTs and microscopy) was low in this study. The low use of microscopy at 39.2% for diagnosis in this study is similar to the findings of a previous study in Nigeria where a study based on an audit of 665 patients' records from public and private hospitals found that 45% of patients had diagnostic blood slides [20]. Laboratory diagnosis can improve rational provision of malaria treatment service as it has been found that prescribing anti-malarials only after laboratory confirmation reduced the total number of prescriptions by 68% in Malawi [21]. The level of awareness of RDTs by all the providers was not high enough for such an item of enormous utility as RDTs. This calls for the employment of means of creating awareness about RDTs among health workers. If people do not know about a new product and the likely benefits that could accrue from its use, they are not likely to use it and this may lead to market failure. Doctors, CHEWs and laboratory technologists were more likely to be aware of RDTs than nurses. This is not unusual for the laboratory technologists since their main job is to conduct tests. The respondents in urban areas and in public facilities were more likely to be aware of RDTs. The reason for this may be that more attention has been paid to public facilities by government and partner agencies in recent times to improve the case management of malaria in Nigeria.
544861;2;If more than half of the respondents said RDTs were ever available at their facility of work, and yet the rate of use is low, it then becomes a cause for concern and a threat to the current effort to improve the case management of malaria. Some health workers gave the unreliability of RDTs as a reason for not utilizing available RDT kits. This suggests they do not trust the results despite the fact that RDTs have been found to have a sensitivity of 90.6% and a specificity of 95.9% in Nigeria [9, 10]. It has been noted that health workers still treat for malaria even when RDT result is negative [22]. However, most of the health workers who are still using RDTs tend to be satisfied with the results they get. It is possible that poor technique, or even poor preservation of the RDT kits could give rise to poor results which made some health workers to say they stopped using RDTs because it was not reliable. Heat-stability has been noted to be a major concern for some RDTs, especially under field conditions and the health workers may have been exposed to different brands of RDTs including those with health stability problems [14]. Interestingly, RDTs were more available in the rural facilities than urban facilities, a finding that favours the scaling-up of RDTs since a majority of Nigerians live in rural areas. However, the fact that the government was the source of RDTs for only 3 facilities is worrisome. How does W.H.O. intend to promote the RDT use if the government is obviously lacking any interest? This is further confirmed by the fact that the source of information on RDTs was never through formal training sessions promoted by government, as it should be. Although RDTs are still new in Nigeria and currently there are no policies in place on its usage in the diagnosis of malaria except for that from W.H.O, government should play a lead role and make RDTs available to more public facilities.
544861;3;Surprisingly, the drug of choice for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the study areas was ACT. This is particularly a positive development in the push to improve the case management of malaria in Nigeria. However, this finding contrasts with a Nigerian survey of malaria control practices that showed that less than a fifth of the primary and secondary health facilities used the recommended ACT [2] and that monotherapies such as Chloroquine, SP, Quinine, Artesunate and Dihydroartemisinin were still widely used for treatment of malaria [26]. ACTs especially the recommended first-line types in the national treatment policy (Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) and Artesunate+Amodiaquine (AA) were readily found in public facilities in diverse trade names. However, it will be noted that as a matter of policy, ACTs are supplied free of charge to children who are under 5 years in public health facilities in Enugu, Nigeria [27] and this may have accounted for the large presence of ACT in these facilities. The Nigerian malaria control programme also delivered 4.5 million courses of ACT in 2006 and 9 million in 2007 [4]. ACTs can also be purchased over the counter without a prescription, and can be dispensed by a non medical personnel. In Nigeria, pregnant women and children receive free SP and ACTs respectively from all public health facilities; however this does not apply to private facilities. In the private sector charges are fixed by the owners of the facilities while in government facilities there are often specified fees for services.
544861;4;The study shows that ACTs were still not readily available in private facilities but were more available in both types of facilities than RDTs. This calls for strategies to ensure that both ACTs and RDTs are made available to private health care providers at a subsidized rate in form of public private partnership. But in doing this, there is need for sustainable monitoring systems as monitoring and influencing the quality of private services is recognized as a key component of effective malaria treatment [28] However, the fact that ACTs are readily available (and not RDTs) and are used and considering the fact that most health workers still employ syndromic approach for the diagnosis of malaria, it then means that some patients will be treated with ACTs without laboratory diagnosis. Parasitological diagnosis of malaria is an important parameter leading to the appropriate use of anti-malarial drugs. Improper and abusive use of ACTs without proper diagnosis will have a direct clinical and economic impact [6, 29, 30]. This therefore calls for interventions at policy and programmatic levels to improve treatment provision. And one obvious intervention will be ensuring that providers stocked adequate doses of RDTs and ACTs and subsequently used them so as to decrease unnecessary treatment and reduce societal costs of malaria. We did not review the brands of RDTs found in these facilities and we acknowledge this to be a limitation of the study. Further studies should audit the type of RDTs in these facilities as they vary greatly in effectiveness. The sampled facilities may not be a representative sample for the whole country and therefore the results may not be representative of the country. Nevertheless, we believe that this is a representative sample of all health facilities in the area of study and the state and therefore a good starting point in understanding the tremendous gap existing between the optimal, W.H.O. promoted policies of RDTs and ACTs and the real application in practice.
361983;1;This study showed that in an area with moderate malaria transmission, more than a third of patients with positive HRP2-based RDT tests had a negative blood film and may have been incorrectly diagnosed as a case of clinical malaria due to persistence of the HRP2 antigen from an earlier infection. It is possible that a few patients with submicroscopic or low levels of parasitaemia might have been wrongly classified as negative with microscopy. However this number is likely to have been very small as blood films were read carefully by two experienced microscopists. In contrast, nearly all RDT positive patients in a site with low endemicity were true positives. False positive error rates declined with increasing age of patients, probably as the result of acquired immunity in clearing parasite antigens. Previous studies have shown that HRP2-based RDTs can lead to high false positive error rates. Swarthout et al reported that by using Paracheck-Pf , 73% of cases were still RDT test positive 35 days after treatment and that the false positive error rate correlated with initial parasite density [6]. Iqbal et al found nearly 35% of patients still had HRP2 antigenaemia 14 days after treatment despite negative blood films [9]. In another study, 61% of patients had positive HRP2-based RDT tests for more than two weeks after initiation of treatment [10]. These antigens are eventually cleared by anti-HRP2 antibodies, especially anti-HRP2 IgG [11]. The study also showed that the specificity of RDTs varied seasonally in the same area. At the mesonendemic site (Kebisoni), specificity increased as the true parasite rate (as determined by microscopy) decreased at the end of the transmission season. This may have followed from boosting of anti-HRP2 antibodies as a result of infections acquired during the preceding few months. The relatively higher specificity of RDTs at the hypoendemic site compared with the mesoendemic site could, on the other hand, be due to a very low probability of finding patients with recently cleared parasitaemia who sought treatment for non-malarial illnesses.
361983;2;Sensitivity of RDTs was not affected by age of patient or fluctuation in parasite rates during different months. It was, however, affected by parasite density. Patients with high parasite densities were more likely to test positive than those with low parasitaemia. Other studies have also indicated that HRP2-based tests have high sensitivity which increases with parasite density [3]. However, sensitivity can vary from area to area. There are variations in the repeat section of the HRP2 protein between parasite isolates from different areas which might be a reason for wide variations in sensitivity of HRP2-based RDTs in different areas [12]. A study carried out in Uganda showed that the PPV was only 20% at a site of low endemicity (in Kabale District) whereas in other areas with higher endemicity it was much higher, while the NPV was uniformly high (> 97%) [13]. In the present study, estimates of both the PPV and NPV were high at the site with low endemicity in Kenya. Although it has been suggested in one study that sensitivity is affected by age-dependent immune status of patients independent of parasite density [14], no evidence of this phenomenon was found in the present study. It might be argued that some of the variability observed between the sites and during different parts of the year could have resulted from performance variability of the tests used, especially as climatic conditions affect the stability of the devices. Stability is usually more problematic with pLDH-based tests than with HRP2-based tests. Due to variable rates of use in different sites, the use of similar batches of the tests across all sites and seasons could not be ensured. Nevertheless, the devices were purchased at the same times for both countries, and from the same manufacturer during the entire study period. The devices were also stored and used within the recommended temperature and duration. Due to these and the fact that the sensitivity of the tests in Kenya and Uganda were similar (90.0% and 91.0%, respectively), variability in performance of the devices is unlikely to have played a major role. The use of RDTs is probably cost-effective in many situations. A simulation study has indicated that at a 95% confidence level, RDTs are cost-effective compared to presumptive treatment below 62% parasite prevalence rates [2]. However, cost-effectiveness of RDTs can be compromized if patients with negative RDT tests are prescribed antimalarials [15] as has been shown in both Tanzania [16] and Zambia [17] to frequently be the case. A danger of reliance on RDTs is that some patients who require malaria treatment may test negative and be given symptomatic treatment only. In this study, the fact that there were 9% false negative RDT tests among microscopically confirmed cases at Kebisoni, some of whom had high parasitaemia, shows the risk of relying on test results alone. Due to potential variations in the accuracy of RDTs by season, as suggested by the present study, seasonal use of these diagnostic tools may be necessary after careful cost-effectiveness studies in some areas, especially those with mesoendemic transmission.
361983;3;One of the major implications of the findings of the present study is that cost-effectiveness of HRP2-based RDTs is greatly influenced by variations in their sensitivity and specificity between different areas, age groups of patients, and seasons. The study showed that the diagnostic accuracy of HRP2-based RDTs is relatively high in areas or seasons with low transmission, but more area-specific operational studies may be required to evaluate their cost-effective use under different transmission scenarios. For decisions involving the use of these tests, policymakers should take into account the cost implications of treating test negative patients [15], as well as the risk of not treating false negative patients. The cost-effectiveness of HRP2-based RDTs depends on a multitude of factors: overall diagnostic accuracy, prevalence and its seasonal fluctuations, seasonal changes in test specificity, age group of study subjects, parasite density, the relative cost of antimalarials and RDT tests, the relative treatment costs of test negative cases and the extent to which clinicians trust the outcomes. RDT test results should always be interpreted together with clinical assessment of the patient, allowing for fallibility of the devices [20]. In some vulnerable patients (e.g. children), the risk of leaving a false-negative case untreated for malaria may outweigh the costs of over treatment based on clinical diagnosis [4]. Authorities in charge of developing malaria diagnostic policies may have to interpret reports on specificity of HRP2-based RDTs and cost-effectiveness analyses on their use with some caution as there may be wide variations in the determinant factors of accuracy between different studies. In some areas, it may be useful to vary the use of HRP2-based RDTs according to factors such as transmission level, season and age group of patients, but such policies should be based on further area-specific investigations. Especially in situations where the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs is unlikely to be high, health services will need to strengthen microscopy.
451939;1;Our study aimed at assessing the cost-effectiveness of RDT in a systematic manner. Overall, we identified fifteen studies that tried to delve out whether RDT was cost-effective compared with other commonly used malaria diagnosis methods and there was heterogeneity in population age, funding sources, economic and effectiveness measures, and other general study settings across studies. Our analysis took the influence of such variability into account and found that most studies provided supportive evidence in terms of the cost-effectiveness of RDT. However, there were still five studies that did not draw a clear conclusion [28, 33, 34, 36, 38]. This difference can be explained by the accuracy of RDT, the performance of its comparisons, clinicians  compliance with the diagnostic results, total treatment costs, and malaria prevalence. Therefore, we were unable to conclude which strategy would be the most cost-effective with certainty. A wide range of perspectives has been selected by the studies included. Although most of the studies under the societal and health sector perspectives supported the cost-effectiveness of RDT, some could not because of the uncertainty in the costs and an unclear WTP threshold. This might suggest that the diagnosis and treatment of malaria can be unaffordable to patients in many countries. The recommended first-line malaria treatment, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), is expensive and possible increase in treatment costs over time due to therapy resistance and drug prices has been seldom considered by researchers in the field trials. A cost-effective intervention can be considered to receive public funding if it is a public good, or has important externalities and inadequate demand, or is catastrophically unaffordable and has no available insurance, or beneficiaries are poor when utility outcome is not available [43]. Given the expensive treatment costs, it is suggested that malaria case management with RDT should be included in the coverage of health insurance to substantially reduce the economic burden on patients and their families [44, 45]. Another key driver for the cost-effectiveness of RDT is its price [27, 30, 31, 33, 36, 41]. The price of RDT can be determined by its type as combo RDTs are usually more costly than the single tests. In our analysis, it is uncertain whether the cost-effectiveness of RDT could be influenced by the types of RDT. Also, the capability of combo tests to identify plasmodium species can largely influence the cost-effectiveness of RDT because the type of RDT selected will determine not only the accuracy of diagnosis [46], but also the following treatment received. Therefore, for most countries where multiple malaria species dominate, it is necessary to differentiate Plasmodium species such that proper treatment could be delivered. This systematic review included studies from low- and middle-income countries that were assumed to be malaria endemic. The cost-effectiveness of RDT compared to microscopy was not clear in regions with relatively low transmission settings given the uncertainty in how the routine microscopy was performed, i.e., the accuracy of microscopy and whether the microscope was used only for malaria detection. Current evidence suggested that RDT could be more cost-effective than microscopy [29, 37, 39, 41], and the relative advantage of RDT could be further enhanced if microscope was exclusively-used [37]. This could be explained by the fact that the demand for malaria diagnosis would be less in area where malaria prevalence is close to zero, and the cost per suspected patient would be largely increased when taking microscopy as the initial approach. Further studies are required to confirm this, especially in low transmission countries aiming at eliminating malaria. Moreover, facing the reduction of malaria prevalence and movements towards disease elimination [47], it is more common for countries to confront the threat of increasing malaria imported cases [6]. Usually, imported patients are either rural migrant workers or travelers to the endemic region, and tend to have lower parasite densities. The key challenge is to promptly and accurately identify malaria cases at all levels of health systems. Current malaria control programs have established either active or passive case detection systems. Active case detection requires health workers to seek out for patients, making it less feasible to maintain the use of microscopy as the initial approach when the prevalence is extremely low. In addition to this, our requirements for malaria elimination, especially a consistent diagnostic accuracy for community-based primary care, is beyond the capacity of routine microscopy due to the scarcity of well-trained microscopists [48], and essential laboratory supplies. This may limit the performance of microscopy [49], and contribute to misdiagnosis or over-diagnosis with a potential risk of over-consuming antimalarial therapies and drug resistance [50]. In fact, the poor performance of routine microscopy has been widely recognized, even in developed countries [51], and high capital investment of microscopy makes it more costly than RDT if local caseload is low [52]. Therefore, it is meaningful and economically important to introduce RDT in primary health care or remote region where microscopy is unavailable.
451939;2;The CHEERS tool was used to assess the quality of evidence in our research, allowing to compare reporting quality across included studies. The majority of studies identified are of good and moderate quality, but we still found some studies showed poor compliance with the reporting guidance, especially lacking details of research methods. Explanation of model selection was lacked generally, and this might be because studies tended to have more concern about whether RDT was a quick and accurate way to detect malaria cases. It should also be noticed that the scores of studies aimed at measuring the cost-effectiveness of RDT were higher than those only evaluating the costs of the disease detection approaches. In addition, the CHEERS tool focuses on the quality of reporting, and it should be fully considered at the stage of study design, for example, by referring to the structural abstract proposed by NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and extracting basic characteristics and results of health economic evaluations to improve the quality of evidence.
451939;3;This review is limited in the following aspects: firstly, the studies identified were conducted in a limited range of countries, most of which were located in Africa. Whether results obtained from the context can be transferable to other countries was not elaborated in the included studies. It is obvious that countries may vary in their widely-used malaria diagnostic methods and other features such as prevalence and the types of RDT. Differences in health care systems and reimbursement also limit the transferability of our results. Thus, caution should be taken when applying the results to other settings. Another limitation was inadequate data on costs and effectiveness, possibly due to differences in adopting primary and secondary outcome indicators among studies, adding to the difficulty in comparing ICERs obtained when they had the same perspectives. Therefore, no synthesized outcome was shown due to the wide difference across studies and the lack of evidence regarding health utility gained when using different malaria diagnostic techniques. We suggest that further economic evaluations of malaria detection methods should focus on health utility benefits for patients who are susceptible to the disease.
359124;1;Most causes of fever in the tropics are transient, non-fatal illnesses. In the latter half of the 19th century, it was discovered that many of the infectious causes of fever that did have the potential to be fatal, including malaria, leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, sleeping sickness and others, were detectable by microscopy. For one of these, malaria, there was a relatively early pharmacological intervention thanks to the long history of quinine (cinchona) use in the Americas. The utility of microscopy in tropical fevers, and the availability of life-saving treatment for malaria, led to the wide advocacy of microscopy-based case management as the standard of care. When microscopy was found to be untenable in many parts of the world, due to the massive effort and resources required to maintain such a service in close proximity to the rural and poor populations widely at risk, syndromic management, classifying all 'malaria-like' fevers as malaria, again became the de facto standard of practice. For the last three quarters of a century then, since the discovery and development of chloroquine in the 1930s and 40s, the medical community has treated most fevers in malaria-endemic countries as malaria, forgoing the diagnostic process. This practice has been codified into national and international recommendations and training manuals for health workers, especially for fever in children. The common teaching has been 'fever equals malaria unless proven otherwise'. Clearly many lives have been saved by pushing for rapid, even community or home-based access to antimalarial therapy, regardless of diagnostic testing. In the many communities in which malaria has accounted for the majority of potentially fatal causes of fever, it has been hard to imagine any other approach, given the poor performance and relative unavailability of microscopy [1 6]. Over the past decade, though, a number of important changes have taken place in the epidemiology and control of malaria and in the diagnostic techniques available, that dramatically alter the balance of rational action in favour of parasite-based diagnosis over blind therapy of fever with anti-malarial drugs. Specific diagnosis of malaria is now not only possible, but necessary, and scaled up malaria control efforts, including elimination plans, must include expanded and quality assured use of parasite-based diagnostic testing and reporting of results.
1012871;1;The Study was conducted in the outpatient department of paediatrics LUMHS Hyderabad from June to December 2010. All febrile children under 5 years of age classified as suspected clinical malaria confirmed slide microscopy, and also the effectiveness of RDT was measured by using expert microscopy as gold standard. The sensitivity (95%), specificity (91.6%), PPV (0.55%) and NPV (99.3%) of RDT were similar to that reported elsewhere.16 Overall, the performance of RDTs was similar to that of microscopic analysis performed by an experienced microscopist. Compared to microscopy, RDT specificity relative to that of microscopy was lower (91.0%) is similar to other studies.13,16,17 Our study has very low PPV which is similar to other of other studies 11,13 The low PPV is due to the fact that RDT detect the antigens but not the parasite as slide microscopy, and antigens may persist in the serum for couple of weeks even after successful treatment giving false positive results 17 . But RDT sensitivity was excellent (95.%) and an excellent NPV of 99.5%. These encouraging results justify using RDTs to diagnose malaria in areas that are most in need of low-cost diagnostic techniques. The risk of a false-negative RDT result depends on several factors: the RDT itself (brand and even lot variation, including performance in practice) and malaria species, density, and background prevalence. Well-performed laboratory studies have shown RDT sensitivities to be generally same 18.
2593776;1;A number of studies on RDTs have been conducted, although measures of accuracy have varied widely, as a result of differences in methodology, study site epidemiology and type of RDT used i.e. histidine rich protein - 2 (HRP-2) and plasmodium specific lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) and species specific pLDH or aldolase based test [27], [28], [17]. Ideally, bivalent RDTs will help to target anti-malarial treatment for P. vivax and P. falciparum by grass root workers who provide on the spot diagnosis and treatment in areas where microscopy cannot be established. The required sensitivity of a test may also vary with species, a less sensitive test may be acceptable for detection of P. vivax compared to detection of P. falciparum as severe outcomes due to missed diagnosis are less likely [29]. The present study assessed the performance of various bivalent RDTs in field population. Overall, highest sensitivity for P. falciparum was >95% and for P. vivax ?80%. The high frequency of positive smears in this study is consistent with previous studies in Central India [30]. Likewise the sensitivity and specificity estimates are consistent with previous studies [10]. Further, when the results of this study was compared with WHO, FIND and CDC product testing of RDTs, where the evaluation was performed against a standardized panel of cultured P. falciparum and frozen blood samples (200 2000 parasites/ l of blood) by experienced technicians in a research laboratory and not in field as done in the present study, the results of the WHO, FIND and CDC are comparable to this study with regard to diagnostic performance of five RDTs evaluated in both the studies. Additionally, first field based evaluation of commercially available RDTs regarding their temperature stability was also carried out in the present study. Among the 7 bivalent RDTs, most RDTs for P. falciparum showed a very high sensitivity over period at 35 and 45 C upto day 90 in terms of percentage of successful tests. While for P. vivax, the FIRST RESPONSE maintained good sensitivity over period at 35, 45 C upto day 90 and showed a decline in sensitivity on day 100. Parascreen was also good upto day 90 at 35 C only and showed a sharp decline in sensitivity on day 100. These results are consistent with those of WHO, FIND and CDC product testing of RDTs.
2593776;2;Heat stability is vital to maintaining sensitivity of the test in the field [22], [30]. HRP-2 is a very stable antigen [31], while pLDH may degrade during long storage [11], [22]. Wide variations in stability between various RDTs were recorded in this study. The lacks of quality control of RDTs present a risk to patients through incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate anti-malaria treatment [32]. As a result for procurement, it is essential that careful consideration be given to stability results to ensure that RDTs works under extreme temperature. All the RDTs in this evaluation were packaged in individual envelopes that contain a desiccant. This allows the health worker to open the envelope of a test at the time of use in field limiting exposure to high humidity [12] as the field trial for stability testing was carried out during peak rainy season. The stability testing results presented here provide assessment of both, stability of the RDT and also the quality of its packaging [12]. However, there are some potential limitations in generalizing our results to predict the success of implementing RDTs at high temperature. Though temperature was held constant in this evaluation, humidity was not maintained. Temperature and humidity in field fluctuate with time of day and season and 100 days storage may not accurately predict long term stability under field conditions. Loss of parasite detections over this period indicates that chances of decline in sensitivity cannot be overruled [12]. It is worthwhile to mention here that field trial was carried out during July March thus all 3 seasons i.e. monsoon, autumn and summer were covered. An additional limitation of this study was that highly trained individual performed all the testing in this evaluation. In field settings malaria RDTs will often be used by health workers with limited training and supervision. Temperature upto 45 C is likely in uncontrolled storage in tropical countries and temperature may further increase during transport [33]. The overall agreement and Kappa values between pairs of observers were excellent for both positive and negative results. Likewise, for heat stability testing for P. falciparum generally agreement and Kappa values were good for all RDTs however, for P. vivax the Kappa was not good for most RDTs on day 90 and 100. Thus the use of RDTs widely in the programme will require considerable regulation and quality control [34]. Further research is required to determine why some RDTs examined were more susceptible to heat stress in order to improve their temperature stability.
2593776;3;In view of this, while malaria RDTs can be applied in a number of settings, the greatest potential for impact on public health is in extension of access to accurate, parasite based diagnosis of malaria to regions and populations where good quality microscopy based testing is impractical to maintain, making possible the implementation of recent WHO/NVBDCP recommendation on parasite based diagnosis prior to anti-malarial therapy [25], [35]. However, if the RDTs are to replace microscopy in field for malaria diagnosis, they must be able to work with high level of reliability at high ambient temperature. Diagnostic testing by microscopy or RDT to a level of 200 parasites/ l will reliably detect nearly all clinically relevant infections in malaria endemic areas [10], [36]. However, as some countries move towards elimination, population immunity will be decreased and it will increasingly important to use diagnostic tests that detects low parasite densities [17], [37], [38]. Therefore, the ability to detect low parasite density infections reliably therefore, remains important as malaria elimination initiative is increasing in several countries.
2593776;4;Nevertheless, the challenges associated with establishing the routine use of RDTs in rural remote setting where microscopy could not be established should be tackled carefully as the distribution of RDTs and antimalarials must occur hand in hand to ensure effective case management of febrile disease. These results also suggest that the quality of RDTs should be regulated and monitored more closely. We also noticed a wide range in pricing for RDTs ranging from 0.70$ to 2$. However, high price of RDTs is not an assurance of good performance. Therefore, continued search and eventually introducing other alternative and highly sensitive low cost malaria diagnostic methods should also be explored which are capable of detecting low parasitaemia at high ambient temperature.
362249;1;With improvements in malaria control and relatively higher costs of antimalarial treatment, there is increased opportunity for cost savings through the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests in facilities and/or communities where microscopic confirmation of malaria diagnosis is not reliably available [28]. Amexo and others suggest that it is unethical to continue with high levels of malaria misdiagnosis in light of the introduction of expensive antimalarials and availability of cost-effective methods of diagnosing malaria (such as RDTs) [7]. This argument in favour of limiting antimalarial use to confirmed cases is strengthened by considering the enormous effect of drug pressure on antimalarial resistance and the potential for adverse reactions. This study shows that the introduction of RDTs is likely to be cost saving when a relatively more expensive ACT is used for treatment, provided no more than 52% of those patients clinically diagnosed to have malaria are found to be parasitaemic. This result holds even when relatively less expensive ACTs (e.g. AS+SP or the current preferential price to WHO for AL) are used, but the higher the price of the ACT, the greater the cost savings from introducing definitive diagnosis and the higher the cut-off point at which RDTs become cost-saving. Many countries in Africa have well below 60% of clinically diagnosed malaria patients being confirmed on RDT or microscopy. A study in Uganda found that only 57% of those clinically diagnosed as having malaria were actually parasitaemic [29]. From several studies undertaken separately in 15 countries, Amexo and others (2004) report that on average there is a 61% overestimation of malaria cases when clinical diagnosis is used [7].
362249;2;As malaria control improves as a consequence of widespread use of insecticide treated bednets [30], indoor residual spraying [23] and or ACT use [16 18, 31], the proportion of clinical malaria (fever) cases that would be definitively diagnosed as malaria will decrease. Consequently the introduction of definitive diagnosis with RDTs at the same time as the introduction of ACT would become increasingly cost saving, because there would be fewer suspected cases to test and even fewer cases to treat. Findings from our study show that the introduction of definitive diagnosis (using RDTs) is cost-saving even when we only consider a narrow perspective of costs related to malaria treatment (i.e. costs of RDTs and antimalarials). While the use of RDTs in all suspected cases has been shown to be cost-saving in some instances, our findings also show that targeting RDTs at the group older than six years and treating all children less than six years on the basis of clinical diagnosis is even more cost-saving. In semi-immune populations, young children carry the largest malaria disease burden and many healthcare providers would find it harder to deny antimalarials to those who test negative in this age-group.
362249;3;Findings from the analyses show that results are sensitive to the effects of changes in age distribution of the symptomatic population, and price of ACTs and price of RDTs. Increasing proportions of older patients result in increased cost savings with RDT introduction (due to lower costs of antimalarials for children, and fixed cost of RDTs). As the prices of antimalarial treatment increase, RDT implementation becomes increasingly cost saving. However, when less expensive ACTs are introduced, such as for the current WHO preferential price of $1.44 per adult treatment, the RDT price to the healthcare provider should be $0.65 or lower for RDTs to be clearly cost saving in populations with between 30% and 52% of clinically diagnosed malaria cases being confirmed malaria cases.
362249;4;The analysis of the potential benefits of introducing RDTs in combination with ACTs is more complex if the majority of malaria treatment is self-administered or sought in the private and informal sectors. Furthermore, for treatment of fever cases testing negative for malaria, some healthcare providers may still use antimalarials and there may be an increased risk of irrational use of other drugs, particularly antibiotics. This necessitates integrated training and supervision of health workers in rational drug use for the treatment of non-malaria fever cases and enhanced drug utilisation monitoring, particularly at the time of RDT introduction. Village health volunteers in Laos were found to only require minimal training (one hour) to sustain reliable use of RDTs over a 10 month period [32]. In contrast, a study conducted in Zambia, where specific training and supervision of healthcare providers was not provided, significant underutilization of RDTs or the inappropriate prescription of antimalarials when patients test negative have been documented [5]. However, a study in Tanzania concluded that use of rapid diagnostic tests, with a single training emphasising that negative malaria tests should lead to alternative diagnoses being considered, did not lead to lead to any reduction in over treatment for malaria [6]. Although the additional benefits of avoiding the use of ACTs to patients in whom the malaria diagnosis is negative could not be included in this study, these are likely to be substantial. Assuming education interventions succeed in ensuring that test results are accepted by healthcare providers, patients and caregivers, excluding malaria would facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment of the actual cause of the disease for those who are malaria test negative, and would minimise the treatment seeking costs related with repeat visits and the productivity losses associated with prolonged illness. It has been argued that the effects of malaria misdiagnosis fall most heavily on the poor and vulnerable who are least able to withstand prolonged ill-health and the associated missed opportunities for earning an income [9]. In addition, the use of definitive diagnosis would provide more reliable data on malaria cases, hence allowing for accurate forecasting of required antimalarials for planning and budgeting and better monitoring of the effectiveness of malaria control interventions. Also, drug pressure, and consequently, the rate of spread of antimalarial resistance could be decreased.
362249;5;It is also important to note that clinical diagnosis may fail to pick up some patients who actually have malaria. Luxemburger and others found that none of the malaria symptoms alone or in combination proved to be a reliable predictor of malaria, and at best clinical diagnosis would result in prescription of antimalarials in 29% of the non-malaria febrile illnesses and 49% of the true malaria cases (suggesting that 51% of the infections would go untreated initially) [7]. It is important to note that RDTs are unlikely to be used if malaria is not clinically suspected and so will not address the problem of false negatives arising from clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, the extent to which RDTs are cost-effective depends on their accuracy in diagnosing malaria. Studies have found varying levels of sensitivity and specificity of the different RDT products on the market. Swarthout and others (2007) recently reported 52% specificity of Paracheck-Pf in Democratic Republic of Congo and noted that as many as 92% of children were still false positive at day 28 following treatment with artemether-lumefantrine [34]. Similar results are reported by Kleinschmidt and others (2007) for Equatorial Guinea [35].
361337;1;The study findings suggest that stakeholders have a positive attitude towards the anticipated malaria vaccine and that their acceptance of the vaccine remains high despite the fact that it would be used parallel with other existing intervention strategies. Interestingly, the acceptance level also remains significant though the malaria vaccine is less likely to provide full protection. This outcome could be a reflection of how malaria is seriously perceived in the communities being studied. Furthermore, they may be willing to accept the new malaria interventions as long as they will (to some extent) contribute to the reduction of malaria, especially among children. Similarly, a study in Kenya also found that participants understood that malaria is a serious problem that no single tool can be used to combat it, which influences their acceptance of malaria vaccine [14]. Acceptance of malaria vaccine was also observed in studies conducted in Ghana [13] where the views of various professions and communities also reflected a positive opinion towards the introduction of malaria vaccine as a preventive tool. The study finding that stakeholders would still maintain the acceptance of malaria vaccine in the context of existing malaria intervention strategies is in line with the overall idea of introducing the vaccine which is not meant to replace the existing malaria interventions but rather to compliment it [11].
361337;2;In this study, social cultural aspects emerged as factors associated with the acceptance of malaria vaccine. These factors include religion (Christians were more willing than Muslims to accept the vaccine), religion (Ndali tribe was less willing to accept the vaccine than the other tribes), and civil servants were more willing to accept the vaccine than the farmers. This finding corroborates with evidence from other countries in Africa [24] and elsewhere [25] where religion and ethnicity were found to influence health care utilization. Specific evidence also indicates that religion and ethnicity are associated with vaccine awareness and acceptance i.e measles vaccine and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) [25, 26]. The differences in vaccine acceptance based on religion, ethnicity and occupation as observed in this study could also reflect that people s values, preferences and expectations would sometimes constrain their acceptance of a particular health care programme. These could originate from the culture in which the social interaction is taking place, which in turn govern their decisions about how they should pursue a recommended health intervention [27]. Although other studies have found that the quality of care i.e. congestion, delays, and the perceived attitudes of the health care providers [14], access to services, reliability of services fear of side effects, and parental beliefs and conflicting priorities [28] constraints immunization services, this study shows that in addition to individual and health system factors, the social cultural aspects may play a significant role in influencing the differential acceptance of vaccination programmes. This is central in this paper, and it lends support to the views of other researchers that people may not automatically use a health intervention once introduced [14], and in the context of a vaccine, if the known barriers are not addressed may lead to under-utilization of immunization coverage [16, 29].
361337;3;Currently there is a strong recognition globally that health is socially determined and that social-structural aspects are responsible for health inequity. As found in this study, religion and ethnicity may play a significant role towards inequity in immunization coverage. Health inequity is known to be a set back to the wider health development, and this could be addressed by examining the wider social and structural aspects that increase vulnerability to diseases [30 33]. Evidence in Nigeria indicates that the community tailored interventions have proven to be effective in increasing the utilization of polio vaccination [34]. As such, the public health communication strategy that seek to promote the available immunization services as well as the anticipated malaria vaccine could be made effective if tailored within the broader social aspirations and cultural differences existing in the locally contextualized environment.
361337;4;This study also found that the community and other professionals have multiple expectations and questions that relate to the anticipated malaria vaccine. It is important that the Tanzanian Immunization Department, malaria vaccine initiative, and other malaria stakeholders clarifies the questions and expectations prior to or parallel with the introduction of the malaria vaccine and provide the correct knowledge about the added value of malaria vaccine in lay man s language to avoid any misconceptions about the anticipated malaria vaccine. The voices of communities and that of the health care professionals are important and should be considered for better informed decisions, policy recommendation, planning and designing of a communication strategy. Failure to account for community s prior information that could enlighten policy makers on what is needed to be considered before the implementation of the intervention was found as one of the factors that could delay the public acceptance of the proposed intervention [14].
360871;1;The wording for recommendations was finalized by MPAC during their closed session following the two-and-a-half days of open sessions; conclusions have been included in the summaries of the meeting sessions above, and links to the full set of meeting documents have been provided as references. Position statements and policy recommendations made by the MPAC are approved by the WHO Director-General, and will be formally issued and disseminated to WHO Member States by WHO-GMP or if more appropriate, the WHO Regional Offices. Conclusions and recommendations from MPAC meetings are published in the Malaria Journal as part of this series.
360871;2;MPAC provided suggestions for the agenda for its next meeting to the WHO-GMP Secretariat. Feedback will also be given to and received from the global malaria community at the RBM Board meeting in May 2013, and through the publication of and correspondence regarding this article. Ongoing engagement with and attendance by interested stakeholders at MPAC meetings continues to be encouraged. In addition to open registration for MPAC meetings, which will continue (via the WHO-GMP website starting in July) and attendance by four standing observers (RBM, the Global Fund, UNICEF, Office of the UN Special Envoy for malaria), the active participation of seven rotating NMCP representatives, and all six WHO Regional Malaria Advisors, was strongly welcomed.
995302;1;For PDPs to achieve their goals, partnership is essential. PDP access staff can initiate these partnerships by bringing together different parties, such as scientists, manufacturers, regulators, and implementers. This combination of perspectives from the scientific, commercial and public health worlds can support more informed decision making [34]. In order to reach multiple countries, the involvement of WHO headquarters, country and, in particular, regional offices has been and will remain critical, particularly for diseases such as HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria that have a significant number of WHO staff. Regional WHO offices can track the progress of multiple countries as they move through the multi-part decision process. Table 4 describes possible partners, including WHO, and some of their advantages and disadvantages. Manufacturers have traditionally supported some aspects of country decision-making and all the aspects of product launch. However, many originator companies may have limited experience of introduction into low and middle income country markets (some Indian and Chinese generics may be more established in these markets). Companies may also be concerned that they could be perceived to be self-serving if supporting decision-making around the introduction of a new product directly in countries. Thus, the initial information sharing and country decision making step will generally require the involvement of other actors, including PDPs. An interesting example of division of labor comes from Uganda, where PATH, a not-for-profit that has worked extensively as a PDP, is supporting a demonstration project for human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines (E. Mugisha, pers. comm.). Before any activities started, PATH signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Uganda (GoU) to specify who would do what. The GoU committed to provide health services delivery infrastructure, human resources in the districts, and EPI staff for delivery of the vaccine. The two PATH technical staff members, located in the WHO Uganda office, provided technical and logistical support. PATH also provided transport allowances (but no per diems) to health workers in the field and funded local university researchers to conduct the formative research and operations research. WHO and UNICEF participated in a technical advisory committee set up by the Ministry of Health (MoH) to oversee the demonstration project, and also helped with monitoring of vaccination. The relevant pharmaceutical company (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK)) donated and shipped vaccines to Uganda, but had no other role in the project. UNFPA and other stakeholders provided input on reproductive health issues, and NGOs (e.g., CARE and Save the Children) helped with mobilization in the districts. Thus, PATH served as the glue across the various organizations in support of the MoH.
995302;2;Despite these challenges, successful PDP support of country decision making is possible. The case studies below illustrate that PDPs have taken many distinct approaches to facilitating country decision making. These are examples of what has been done, rather than normative descriptions of what would be ideal. They were selected to represent a range of modalities (e.g., vaccine, drug, and insecticide) and disease areas, and the kinds of activities conducted at different stages of the decision process (presented below in roughly chronological order). Different PDPs have undertaken a range of activities, such as those shown in Tables 1 and 2, with this selection depending on needs identified by each PDP, typically in consultation with partners like WHO and countries. Not surprisingly, the more extensive experience generally lies with the PDPs who have approved products. Engagement prior to product availability For DNDi, country engagement begins with the identification of needs by and with endemic country stakeholders. Certain key research organizations in endemic countries contributed to DNDi's founding, are represented on its Board of Directors, and greatly inform the definition of needs and of the related Target Product Profiles (TPPs). These organizations also facilitate clinical and intervention trials and, ultimately, national decisions on adoption. Three additional PDPs, whose activities are outlined below, do not yet have products approved by regulatory agencies but nonetheless conduct activities related to country decision making. For malaria vaccines, MVI initiated a 3 year process with countries, WHO and, in the later stages, the Roll Back Malaria Partnership (RBM) to develop decision-making frameworks, initially for 9 individual countries and then for the African region [33]. The final framework builds upon existing WHO guidelines [22], and lays out what data are needed from different sources (global vs national), in different thematic areas (disease burden, other malaria interventions, impact, financial, efficacy, safety, programmatic, sociocultural), and at different times (pre-licensure, licensure, and post-licensure); it also notes whether each is essential or desirable. It provides a similar framework for policy processes. The framework process has and will structure dialogues around malaria vaccines with countries around technical issues. In some countries, it has led to the formation of ongoing structures that have begun to collect data to inform an eventual decision (e.g., technical working groups - MVI now sponsors three of these). In contrast to MVI, the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance) is entering an area that has existing products. There was, however, relatively little analysis of the market, of decision making, or of how new products would be considered. TB Alliance therefore focused on conducting sequential stakeholder studies in the following areas: the size and structure of the existing TB drug market; what local stakeholders want from a new TB regimen; how the experience with past TB regimen changes can inform future approaches; and what producers and products are dominant in the private sector. These studies helped to identify issues and categories of data relevant for future country decision making [12, 31], initiate engagement with local stakeholders, provide opportunities for the promotion of regimen change issues in international fora, and frame conversations with local stakeholders during TB Alliance participation in WHO review missions. Finally, the findings of each study influenced the design and content of the next, and provided essential feedback for the research and development team [2]. TB Alliance selected this approach due to the opportunities and challenges presented by the availability of existing TB treatment regimens and partnerships. The long-term aim of IVCC is to facilitate the development and introduction of new insecticides. Already, however, IVCC is engaging country decision makers to address an identified gap in field implementation - the monitoring and evaluation of vector control programs. This gap is addressed via IVCC's Malaria Decision Support System (MDSS), which is used to track clinical and survey data and insecticide resistance (T. McLean, pers. comm.). This tool is applicable to a wide range of diseases and, in addition to monitoring and evaluation, it supports the management of advanced insecticides, and decision making on adopting new vector control products. Based on existing partnerships with the ministries of health, IVCC has validated the methodology in 3 countries - Mozambique, Malawi, and Zambia - with varied infrastructure and ecological environments; it is now planning wide-ranging implementation. As a central objective, the MDSS should be adopted and owned by the national malaria control program and serve their information needs. Country consultations and regional meetings Early and frequent consultations with countries are essential for the development of products that are suited to end users [2]. For DNDi, input is channeled via disease platforms, which were formed to assist and strengthen clinical research around specific diseases in a geographic area, e.g., Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in East Africa, sleeping sickness in West Africa, and Chagas Disease in Latin America. These platforms include country program staff, researchers, regulatory officials, NGOs and WHO and meet twice a year. Platform members became natural partners for country decision making as they gather relevant information on in-country issues, programs, and processes and convey key information to in-country decision makers. The Pneumo-ADIP (now part of the International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)) built on experience with Hib and Hepatitis B vaccine introductions to support pneumococcal vaccine introduction [9]. Under the Pneumo-ADIP, the establishment of surveillance networks had two positive outcomes: it provided the requested data on projected coverage and impact and, via annual investigators' meetings, led to the identification of local advocates. In addition, regional meetings organized in collaboration with WHO provided an opportunity to check back in and to move countries to put their decisions and proposed actions on paper by presenting their conclusions in front of others (L. Privor-Dumm, pers. comm.). These meetings included EPI managers, directors of health services, researchers, pediatricians, economists, and sometimes donors and financing people from MoH or other ministries, and were a particularly useful mechanism to support decision-making in countries not directly targeted through other interactions. MMV and its drug development partners have also made extensive use of country-level dialogues such as subregional meetings (of WHO AFRO and Roll Back Malaria) and, in select cases, day-long workshops (G. Jagoe, pers. comm.). These provide opportunities to give product-specific briefings and to reinforce recommendations of normative entities (primarily WHO) in terms of best practice for the development and revision of treatment guidelines and for the correct use of new, quality medications in combination with proper diagnosis (case management). Longer-term programmatic collaborations in specific-countries are very limited; the focus is on any initiative (e.g., piloting of an affordable medicines private sector subsidy in Uganda) that address specific access challenges and could serve as guiding lights for policy makers and funders across the larger stage of all malaria endemic countries. In terms of impact, as of September 2010, almost 42 million treatments of Coartem  Dispersible (co-developed with MMV) had been delivered to 32 countries [37]. Regional meetings have been convened by the TB Alliance and partners to gain consensus around regulatory issues [38]. Existing TB drugs were developed more than 40 years ago, in a very different regulatory environment. Agreement was needed on the regulatory approach to development of not just individual new drugs, but new regimens. With the participation of national TB program managers in these meetings, these individuals became part of the conversation about what types of evidence would be available for decision making. Implementation studies as a bridge to adoption When existing evidence is insufficient, implementation studies may be necessary. In India, the Institute for One World Health (iOWH) has supported studies to generate data for advocacy and decision making on VL treatment and elimination. In collaboration with a research institute of the Government of India, they documented the incidence of VL, the financial burden of disease, households' willingness and ability to pay, and treatment-seeking behaviors in both public and private sectors (R. Sarnoff, pers. comm.). In addition, building on the necessary Phase 3 study, iOWH sponsored a Phase 4 study with an effectiveness module that provided training, clinical support, and guidance on pharmacovigilance reporting, and demonstrated effective delivery in public and private facilities. The clinical trial investigators formed a core constituency for local advocacy for improved products. At the national level, iOWH leadership engaged with key stakeholders in the Indian government, World Bank and WHO to inform them of the progress of the studies, identify their key questions and concerns, and address future funding issues. Training modules and community communication models were developed for smooth transfer to the national authorities. DNDi has also used intervention or field trials as an essential step to demonstrate feasibility and generate necessary data for adoption into national programs (F. Camus-Bablon, pers. comm.). For example, Brazil conducted a 25,000-subject malaria intervention trial prior to adopting artesunate and mefloquine (ASMQ) for treatment of falciparum malaria in the Amazon basin. The trial monitored the effects of ASMQ introduction; during the study, a significant impact on malaria cases and related hospitalization also resulted from a more rational use of complementary resources such as insecticides, a detection and reporting system, and the training of local human resources. In this study, one year after the introduction of the ASMQ fixed-dose combination (FDC) and the treatment of 17,000 patients, P. falciparum malaria cases were reduced by nearly 70% and malaria-related hospitalizations dropped by over 60%. Following the study, the Brazilian National Program updated the national malaria treatment guidelines and introduced ASMQ FDC as the first line treatment in the region. Advocacy is also a key component of DNDi implementation work, to inform both international audiences and endemic countries. In some areas, DNDi relies on pharmaceutical and other international partners. For example, WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) department and M decins Sans Fronti res (MSF) are key drivers for the adoption of nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) for the treatment of sleeping sickness, which, within a year, has been adopted in the national treatment policy of nine endemic countries and ordered by six. Sanofi-Aventis (SA), within two years of WHO pre-qualification, was planning to distribute 50 million artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) treatments in 2010. Today, ASAQ is registered in 27 African countries and in India. SA is conducting a 15,000 patient pharmacovigilance program in partnership with DNDi and MMV in Ivory Coast, and developed a specific package for social interventions and home based management programs. Evaluation of impact There are significant challenges in estimating the impact of PDPs on country decision making. First, most PDPs are relatively young, being established in the last 10 years. Given the time required to develop a product, many have not yet had products launched, and the product launches that have occurred are recent. Second, there is not yet agreement on how to measure impact - in particular, whether to focus on usage (e.g., number of individuals treated; see the data on new product usage noted in this paper) or on process (the number of countries conducting a policy process and reaching the decision that is best for their particular situation; see [39] for an example). Third, if a product is suboptimal - too expensive, insufficiently efficacious, or too difficult to use, for example - it is unlikely to be rescued by PDP support of country decision making, even if those support activities are well executed. In other words, success under the first (usage) definition is only likely when the new product continues to meet identified country needs. This is why access input is essential throughout the product development process [2]. There have, however, been efforts by PDPs to define metrics of success and to evaluate PDP work in support of country decision-making. For impact using the process definition of success, one example is the malaria vaccine decision-making framework [39]. The development of this framework has been independently evaluated [40]. Out of 84 respondents from 10 countries, 90% felt that the framework developed will be extremely or very useful in preparation for a decision (i.e., in deciding what activities to undertake prior to having a licensed product), and 88% indicated the same for taking a decision after a vaccine is licensed. Facilitators were reported to be neutral instead of supporting one product. A 2007 study by the GAVI Alliance tried to quantify the impact of the Pneumo- and Rotavirus ADIPs and Hib Initiative as compared to what may have happened if they had not been in place [41]. The authors found that the Pneumo-ADIP is likely to shave at least five years off the time from development to availability of vaccines in the poorest countries, and that the work of the Rotavirus ADIP may result in the poorest countries accessing vaccines only one year after availability in the developed world, which is years and decades shorter than historically. Based upon this, the authors reported value in terms of lives saved and hospitalizations averted. Given the constraints noted above, the current paper does not aim to provide a rigorous evaluation of PDP impact and strategies, but instead provides a situation analysis, reflecting the range of strategies undertaken by PDPs and detailing the rationale behind their choice. It is clear that having no engagement specifically around new products leads to lengthy delays in availability [1]. At the same time, it is too early to determine the optimal strategies for each situation and type of intervention. However, the current analysis provides an important baseline or reference point for a later impact analysis of PDP work on access.
363993;1;Throughout this period of increased vaccine effort, WHO has had an important role in supporting various aspects of basic research projects through the WHO/UNDP/World Bank Special Programme (WHO/TDR) and has also played a major normative role in providing guidance on many aspects of vaccine development. Landmark meetings were held to highlight the need for improved adjuvants, by bringing together representatives of groups involved in developing and testing new potential products, recognizing that malaria antigens were often involved in the first wave of testing novel agents [7]. WHO worked with funding agencies to convene meetings of scientists, regulators and others to review the state of the art of vaccine development, reviews of key ethical issues [8], and maintains an ongoing record of malaria vaccines under development (known as the Rainbow Table) [3]. Perhaps most importantly, WHO has worked with its advisory committees to gather best evidence then provide guidance for vaccine trial designs that ensure that results generated are relevant for establishing subsequent policy recommendations, to assist national programmes in malaria-endemic countries. WHO s advisory committees are a key mechanism for identification of research priorities for immunization and for development of consensus-based guidance on clinical development and testing of vaccines. The WHO Malaria Vaccine Advisory Committee (MALVAC) succeeded IMMAL and VDR Committees, and provides advice to WHO on strategic priorities, activities and technical issues related to global efforts to develop vaccines against malaria, with emphasis on the public health needs of developing countries. In the five years 2008 2013 MALVAC has convened eight key meetings of experts, together with several working groups, whose detailed assessments have provided valuable consensus views on priorities and best practice for selected vaccine-related research and development strategies. By providing the leading independent global malaria vaccine forum for funding agencies, sponsors and investigators, WHO has increased collaboration between key malaria vaccine R&D stakeholders. WHO has also improved the comparability of key endpoints by convening technical groups to provide consensus based protocols and Standard Operating Procedures, ensuring extensive consultation amongst stakeholder groups. The technical areas for these consultations have included design and conduct of sporozoite challenge trials, Standard Operating Procedures for malaria microscopy in challenge trials, [9] optimization of clinical challenge trials for asexual blood stage vaccines, measures of efficacy of malaria vaccines in phase IIb and phase III trials, workshops on standardization of malaria vaccine immunoassays, evaluation of assays and trial designs to be applied to interventions against malaria transmission, development of whole organism vaccines for malaria endemic countries, and priorities in research and development of vaccines for Plasmodium vivax and their evaluation. Recently, WHO highlighted the need for information-sharing among HIV, TB and malaria vaccine communities and working with NIAID convened a technical forum on heterologous prime-boost immunization across the three diseases [10]. Furthermore the MALVAC committee will have a key role in advising WHO on the updated version of the Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap [11]. These informed and impartial opinions and recommendations are summarized here to provide guidance on harmonization of strategies that will help to ensure high standards of practice, and comparability between centres and the outcome of vaccine trials. Reference is made to reports of the meetings (and to selected other relevant publications) that provide the more detailed discussions on which the recommendations are based. The text below summarizes the reports of individual meetings and should not be considered to be the position or policy of the WHO. For outcomes of individual meetings, readers are directed to the individual meeting reports. There is a distinct WHO advisory mechanism which provides advice on vaccine candidates in advanced development and approaching possible availability for use. This is known as the Joint Technical Expert Group (JTEG) on malaria vaccines, reporting jointly to the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, and to WHO s Malaria Policy Advisory Committee [12]. MALVAC will continue to provide advice to WHO on the longer term malaria vaccine R&D considerations, with JTEG available to provide evidence reviews for possible policy recommendations when products become sufficiently advanced.
363993;2;Consensus-based guidance on clinical trial design A vital part of the development of candidate malaria vaccines is the careful planning of all phases of clinical trials, always with a view to enhancing comparability between vaccine clinical trials, sites, and alternative development programmes. A second important objective is generation of data to terminate or advance projects appropriately. Phase I trials are used to determine whether candidate vaccines have the required profile of safety and immunogenicity, with Phase IIa trials in malaria designed to provide actionable information on efficacy, safety and immunogenicity including controlled human malaria infection. They are screening trials intended to select candidate vaccines to take forward into field trials, and to select which vaccine formulations to terminate. These proof of concept studies have usually started with adults in non-endemic areas before moving to the target group of children of an endemic area. Phase IIb and III proof of principle field trials require progressively larger numbers of subjects depending on the primary endpoint to be measured and the controls necessary for comparison. Phase III trials are traditionally designed with the primary objective of providing data suitable for regulatory filing. However a focus in malaria vaccines has been to ensure that data are also suitable for evidence-based public health policy recommendations as far as possible. This can avoid the need for additional Phase III trials.  Challenge trials in malaria-na ve volunteers Sporozoite challenge trials for pre-erythrocytic and blood-stage vaccines Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI) [9, 13] are used to assess candidate vaccine efficacy in malaria-naive individuals. Challenge trials in volunteers are important as they inform future clinical trials   whether or not to proceed; dosing, route, schedule and vaccine presentation. This allows iterative improvement of the vaccine construct and its use. Field trials for pre-erythrocytic vaccines should be dependent on first achieving a pre-determined level of efficacy in challenge trials. Future efficacy field trials of new vaccine candidates or combinations may well have to be non-inferiority trials (if RTS,S, for example, is licensed) in regions of reduced transmission, potentially requiring very large sample sizes, thus making them costly and complex with subjects enrolled in several centres. The need to achieve greater confidence in expectations of efficacy prior to initiating multi-million dollar field studies in large numbers of individuals means that even greater reliance may be placed on carefully standardized CHMI studies. They will also be important for the same reasons in go/no go criteria and prioritization of blood stage vaccines (Figure 1). The significant additional challenges with P. vivax challenge trials are considered later. Blood stage challenge trials As an alternative to sporozoites, parasitized erythrocytes can be used to challenge vaccinated individuals [14]. They may have advantages over sporozoite challenge for testing the efficacy of blood-stage vaccines since they allow use of a standardized and low dose challenge and, consequently, a longer period for assessment of induced blood stage immunity before parasites are detected and treatment is required. In contrast, the large sporozoite challenge required to ensure that every control subject is infected may lead to heavy infection and a large numbers of parasites leaving the liver and, as a consequence, earlier detection of parasites requiring treatment.  Rigorous safety depends on having a well-characterized source of erythrocytes free from adventitious agents that meet stringent blood product safety requirements. This is the area of particular concern that for some investigators may still outweigh the perceived benefits of blood-stage challenge. The antigenicity of infected red blood cells in vaccinated volunteers is also a safety issue to be considered. Quantitative PCR monitoring of infection is valuable as it provides a detection threshold of asexual parasitaemia of approximately 20 parasites/ml, well below that possible by microscopy, and potentially increases the time for observations and assessment of efficacy before treatment is required.  There are, however, some drawbacks to use of blood-stage challenge. The challenge bypasses skin and liver stages of infection and removes the possibility of detecting protective cellular immune responses against the late liver stage or antibody against merozoites released from the liver. A low inoculation of parasitized erythrocytes has no counterpart in naturally acquired blood stage infection. Further development of blood stage challenge trials and comparisons with sporozoite challenge are desirable. Development of multiple antigenically distinct parasite strains for evaluation of heterologous protection is also required. Independent evaluation of methods used for modelling parasite growth curves should be made to assist decision-making.  Phase IIb and Phase III malaria vaccine trials Detailed recommendations were made on the implications of different measures of efficacy as they affect vaccine impact, comparability of trials, licensure and wider public health benefits [15]. The conclusions were:  Field evaluation of a vaccine has to be done in the context of other control measures. Assessing efficacy is complicated for malaria where first infection (or vaccination) gives only partial protection against re-infection and the same individual may have multiple episodes of clinical malaria. The primary measure of efficacy is commonly reported as the incidence of first episode of infection or of clinical malaria. This takes no account of subsequent episodes and, from a public health perspective, reduction in the total number of events in some defined time period following vaccination is more relevant than measuring time to first event as the primary efficacy endpoint.  Incident malaria infection is a prerequisite of clinical malaria but, additionally, there can be incident infections without clinical symptoms. If protection against incident malaria infection could be used as a correlate for protection against clinical malaria, this would allow smaller trial sizes and less cost (in malarious areas where many trials are likely to be conducted, incidence of infection is high, with the vast majority of susceptible individuals expected to experience infection in a one to three month period at the peak of local transmission).  A high incidence of malaria and heterogeneity of exposure make estimates of efficacy difficult. In particular, waning of efficacy and heterogeneity in exposure cannot be distinguished by measuring the proportion of individuals remaining disease free at different times after vaccination. Boosting from natural infection should be evaluated. Trial designs in endemic countries will need to be able to detect duration of protection at least up to two years after vaccination, and to rule out deferred or rebound increases in mortality as a consequence of increasing susceptibility following a period of vaccine-induced immunity.  Evaluation of efficacy in the context of existing malaria preventative interventions is a priority. The dosing schedules required for successful vaccination may have implications for feasibility of scale-up. Possible interference with EPI vaccines in infants should be assessed. The possibility of reduced transmission in some field trial sites will need to be addressed in field trial design; larger enrolments may be required, and because age at risk will have extended beyond the ages for EPI, vaccines may also need to be administered to the older children at risk.  Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy should be established prior to a vaccine being given to specific high risk groups (e.g. infants, in pregnancy, and immune-compromised individuals), Monitoring and evaluation plans should include both pharmacovigilance and a sustainable disease burden monitoring system. However these pose major challenges in many malaria-endemic settings.  Impact on malarial transmission (see below) is a key part of assessment of any potential new malaria intervention, although it may not be included in the first Phase III trial. The future combination of single or multi-component candidate malaria vaccines with other malarial interventions should be considered.  As a general rule methods for design and analysis of Phase III trials should be registered in publicly available data bases before results are unblinded. Data sharing will increase understanding of the likely public health impact of a new vaccine in the context of existing control measures.  Post-licensure, data should be acquired on long-term effectiveness in multiple transmission settings and changing control measures and epidemiology, noting the consequences when immune individuals have long periods of reduced exposure, for example whether they become more susceptible to the consequences of later episodes of malaria. The long-term safety must also be evaluated.  Measures of efficacy of interventions against malaria transmission Reduction in transmission remains the fundamental goal of malaria control and measuring changes in transmission allows a better understanding of the interactions between different interventions (vector control, treatment, vaccination) and their combined impact. Some currently available anti-malarial interventions lead to a reduction in transmission even in highly malarious areas, and transmission reduction is the key metric in a malaria elimination strategy.  Better measures of transmission are needed but, as yet, there are no agreed and standardized measures of malaria transmission and these may need to be different in areas of high and low transmission. Measurement of transmission is costly and time-consuming, requiring repeated observations. In some very low transmission areas, incident infection leads to disease and may, therefore, be a surrogate for ongoing transmission. However, in other areas of very low transmission, substantial numbers of asymptomatic infections have been detected with sensitive molecular tools. At low transmission intensity (for example in some of the environments in which transmission blocking vaccines are likely to be tested and introduced) estimates have very large confidence intervals and surrogates are required (see below). Transmission blocking vaccines (TBV) specifically target sexual or sporogonic stage parasites, or mosquito midgut antigens. However, the so-called vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMT) may have their primary effect on other of the three main life-cycle stages but, additionally, may have a significant indirect effect on transmission.  The key effect required for sexual stage or mosquito antigen targets is substantial reduction in the proportion of infected mosquitoes. By contrast, the key effect required for pre-erythrocytic vaccines when viewed as VIMT, is a major reduction in the proportion of humans carrying sexual stages.  A WHO MALVAC meeting considered measures of efficacy of anti-malarial interventions against malaria transmission [16]. The objectives were to evaluate current methods for measurement of malaria transmission and assessment of assays and clinical trial designs that should be applied to measurement of reduction of transmission (of Plasmodium falciparum). The measures considered necessary included:  (i) Epidemiological (incidence of new infections)  (ii) Standardized assays of transmission from humans to mosquitoes (Figure 2) [16, 17]  (iii) Entomological (estimating new human infections by mosquito measures)  (iv) Surrogate serological and molecular measures, e.g. sero-negativity in young children as transmission declines.
360654;1;Understanding the local context of diseases and the communities  perceptions of the experimental interventions serves as prerequisite for how the intervention will be accepted and utilized when it becomes a policy that has to be implemented as a programme. Several studies have documented the need and how best to educate communities [20 23]. This study s findings, which are similar to studies documented on the need to understand the local context of diseases, have benefited from the experiences of such studies and has identified findings as an important step in ensuring the malaria vaccine will be acceptable to communities where this was tested and serve as the springboard for integrating the vaccine into other communities that did not necessarily participate in the trials. It is significant to understand how community members perceive a malaria vaccine in order to inform the country s malaria control managers and officials responsible for the EPI for planning purposes. Our results are similar to that found in Kenya [20]. Knowledge of childhood vaccinations was widespread among respondents. Local names were provided for them, and this could have some positive effects on childhood immunization programmes. Caregivers will at given times be able state which immunizations their children had received and those that they have not received. However in some parts of Mozambique, caregivers mentioned vaccines that do not currently exist [24], and this could have some negative effect on childhood immunization and overall child care.
360654;2;The role of religious beliefs in shaping perceptions and consequently decisions need not be over emphasized. Religious beliefs have the potential of diluting community perceptions on a given phenomenon. The boycott of the polio vaccination programme in some parts of Nigeria was partly because of the belief that the vaccine could be contaminated with anti-fertility, HIV and cancerous agents. This was mainly a concern held by Muslim clerics in Muslim-dominated states and by the Supreme Council for Sharia in Nigeria (SCSN) [12]. Unlike the Nigerian incident, this study revealed a contrary position; religious beliefs that could serve as a potential barrier to the acceptance of a malaria vaccine were virtually unknown in the study area, not even among religious leaders. Religious leaders could therefore be a conduit for a mass introduction of malaria vaccines. In this study there was a community belief children should not be seen until they are more than a month old. In a recent study in Mozambique it was reported that a common taboo among some communities was that a newborn should have limited exposure to adults with  hot bodies  and  hot blood  [24]. The belief about exposure of newborns was not limited to adults only, as reported in the Mozambique study. This belief however is unlikely to affect the administration and coverage of new vaccines, such as malaria vaccines, since some known childhood immunizations such as OPV are given within the first month of life and their coverages are high. Women who deliver carry their children to immunization points for such immunization schedules.
360654;3;The contribution of the environment is key when chronicling factors that contribute to the breeding of mosquitoes. Recent evidence in Tanzania showed that most vector control measures target life-threatening mosquitoes through the use of chemicals belonging to the pyrethroid class; however resistance of mosquito populations to the pyrethroid class of chemicals is increasing dramatically [23]. Community members recognized the role the environment plays in the breeding of mosquitoes. They recognized challenges to malaria vector control, especially when there is growing resistance to available insecticides by mosquitoes. They will therefore welcome a vaccine as one of the ways of surmounting this problem.
360654;4;The popularity of vaccines against tuberculosis, measles and poliomyelitis compared to hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza type B vaccines is because the former vaccines have been in existence over several years compared to the latter. Similar experience was found among Hong Kong Chinese adults, where insufficient awareness of hepatitis B infection was observed. The poor knowledge of this infection may have resulted from the poor knowledge of the universal neonatal and adult hepatitis B vaccination [25]. Health managers and professionals should be aware of the results of this study and revamp their effort towards education on the relatively new vaccines.
360628;1;What is the most appropriate regulatory agency, given the overlap between pharmaceuticals (drug), vector control, and indirect impact on malaria? The proposed use of the drug ivermectin to reduce malaria transmission by its mosquito-killing effect implies the mass administration of the drug to humans; hence, regulatory approval should come from the drug section of a human health agency. The FDA Center for Biologics has been conceptually supportive of a transmission-blocking vaccine. Moreover, it has stated that it could rule on products not primarily intended to be marketed in the United States. It would also rule on products that would have a community effect leading to delayed personal benefit, a key obstacle for licensure for transmission-blocking vaccines [10]. There is no available data on the status on these discussions with the EMA, although it does have Article 58, which supports its offering an opinion on a product to be used primarily in endemic areas outside of EMA s primary geographic remit in collaboration with the WHO and relevant non-EU regulatory authorities. Further discussion with both regulatory agencies by a potential sponsor would be required.  Potential regulatory pathway for ivermectin for malaria vector indication If the goal is application for approval for novel use of the licensed product, then regulatory approval for drug repurposing could be sought via the 505(b)(2) pathway [11]. The 505(b)(2) has the advantage of allowing the use of evidence from studies not conducted by the sponsor, alleviating costs and reducing time to approval. An FDA draft guidance specifically for developing treatment and prophylactic products for malaria was drafted in 2007 [12].  In any case, new tools and/or indications need to be proven effective [13] and safe [14]. For an ivermectin-based vector control tool, the best clinical trial design to demonstrate both safety as well as public health impact on malaria transmission is a pivotal cluster randomized trial with sufficient power to assess both key endpoints. It should demonstrate added value on top of standard vector control tools, which should serve as the referent. As the impact and risk/benefit ratio of ivermectin MDA is expected to vary according to the baseline transmission, the selection of the scenario for the first study is key [15]. Note that this design was successfully utilized to definitely demonstrate the impact of other vector control tools, specifically LLINs [16].  For novel applications or new formulations, the FDA expedited approval process could be an option [17]. The FDA Expedited Approval Process aims to  facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition (using) fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation  [17]. For malaria elimination, both the challenges of residual transmission and insecticide resistance could meet the criterion on unmet medical need, and make ivermectin a good candidate for this approach. Further discussions with regulatory agencies will be needed.  However, the accelerated approval scheme is based on the use of surrogate biological markers of efficacy [18]. In the case of ivermectin, the reduced survival seen in vectors feeding on treated subjects may be an appropriate surrogate marker but is unlikely to lead to regulatory approval, much less policy recommendation and implementation at country level.
1449365;1;The World Health Report has classified interventions with cost-effectiveness ratios of less than the country s per capita GDP as highly cost-effective and those which are 1 3 times the per capita GDP as cost-effective[35]. Most of the interventions we have identified in this study have cost-effectiveness ratios which are well below the Tanzania s estimated GDP per capita of US$ 550[36], hence they can be considered as highly cost-effective. On the other hand, Tanzania has a per capita expenditure on health of about US$ 14 per year[37], which is below the US$ 40 recommended by WHO to finance essential health interventions[38]. This means its ability to implement and scale-up even what can be considered as a highly cost-effective intervention is limited. Our literature review shows that only a few pharmacoeconomic studies have been conducted in Tanzania. Nine out of the twelve studies were on drug therapies and vaccine against infectious diseases which are responsible for more than two-third of the disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa[39]. Nine studies were published within the last ten years, of which six are less than five years old indicating an increasing focus on this research area (Table2). Antimalarial and antiretroviral drugs were the most researched drugs, which mean that to some extent researchers have responded to the importance of the two diseases for the burden of diseases in Tanzania (Table1). Half of the identified studies were on interventions targeting pregnant women and children under the age of five years, reflecting concerns for the high mortality rates for these vulnerable groups in Tanzania.
1449365;2;HIV/AIDS is the number one priority health problem in Tanzania, and affects the most productive age group ranging from 15 59 years, hence impairing the country s economic growth[40]. About 20 per cent of the mortalities for admitted patients above five years of age recorded in Tanzania each year are due to HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis[41]. Our study found two pharmacoeconomic studies on prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and none on case management of HIV/AIDS. PMTCT programs are in transition in Tanzania, responding to the current recommendations consisting of two prophylactic options provided by the WHO. Option A consists of zidovudine (AZT) which is initiated on week 14 of pregnancy, followed with single dose nevirapine (sd-NVP) plus lamivudine (3TC) at the onset of labour until delivery. AZT and 3TC are then continued for 7 days postpartum. Option B is composed of triple ARV drugs which are also initiated on week 14 of pregnancy until one week after cessation of breastfeeding[42]. The task of choosing which option to implement rests on individual countries and should be based on the feasibility, acceptability, safety and costs[42]. This is a practical example where pharmacoeconomic analysis should be used to guide medicine selection.Tanzania has opted to implement option A[43], however, without being guided by cost-effectiveness comparison evidence for option A and B. An economic evaluation study by Robberstad et al. at Haydom Lutheran Hospital in Northern Tanzania showed that option B was highly cost-effective in the Tanzanian settings with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 162 per DALY averted. This regimen was however 40 per cent more expensive than sd-NVP but 5 times more effective[21]. Since option A at the time of the study was not being implemented at the study site, they did not make cost-effectiveness comparisons of option A and B relative to sd-NVP. Drug costs for option B relative to option A which were approximately up to five times in 2009, have been reduced significantly down to two times by the end of 2011[44]. WHO has recently released a new PMTCT update advising countries to adopt the use of option B plus, where a pregnant woman is placed on option B for life regardless of CD4 cell count or clinical staging[45].
1449365;3;Malaria is second after HIV/AIDS on the disease burden in Tanzania. On average about 46 per cent of all in-patient and out-patient cases registered in the healthcare facilities each year are due to malaria[41]. Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children under the age of five years[40, 41]. Malaria during pregnancy is also associated with low birth weight[46], which is recognized as the single greatest risk factor for neonatal and infant mortalities in sub-Saharan countries[47]. A recent study showed that the burden of malaria among adults has been highly underestimated. According to the findings of this study, malaria is also the major cause of deaths among adult populations[48]. Our review found four pharmacoeconomic studies on malaria, two of them being on malaria case management. Tanzania has changed its national malaria treatment policy twice over the past ten years due to drug resistance to formerly effective antimalarials. These policy changes involved replacement of chloroquine (CQ) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), which was subsequently replaced by artemether-lumefantrine (ALu)[49, 50]. Both SP and ALu were at the time the most cost-effective antimalarials compared to alternatives which were available[25, 26]. Our review of treatment guidelines and other relevant policy documents showed inconsistent use of pharmacoeconomic evaluations during malaria treatment policy change. As a result the decision to change to ALu unlike that of changing to SP has been criticized for largely being based on the efficacy rather than cost-effectiveness comparisons[51]. The other two studies were on presumptive treatment of malaria using SP in infants (SP-IPTi) and Deltaprim (a combination of pyrimethamine and dapsone) plus Iron in infants and pregnant women. Studies from African settings have shown that SP-IPTi could reduce episodes of clinical malaria, anaemia and rates of hospitalization in infants by 30, 21 and 38 per cent respectively[32]. As a result SP-IPTi has been adopted by WHO since 2010 as a new malaria intervention strategy targeting infants residing in areas with moderate to high malaria transmissions, but with low resistance to SP[52]. SP-IPTi was demonstrated to be highly cost-effective in Tanzania with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$ 1.57 (0.8-4.0) and US $ 3.7 (1.6-12.2) per malaria episode and DALY averted, respectively[27]. Even though Global Fund and other donors have made financial resources available to support the implementation of this intervention[53], SP-IPTi has not yet been adopted in Tanzania. Studies from the Northern and Southern areas of the country have reported low protective efficacy results from the use of this intervention[54, 55].
1449365;4;Diarrhoea is ranked third on the disease burden in Tanzania and is considered the second main cause of deaths among children under the age of five years worldwide after malaria[56]. Oral rehydration salts (ORS) reduce the duration of diarrhoea episode and replaces the lost water and electrolytes hence preventing the occurrence of dehydration. When Zinc is given as an adjunct therapy for 10 14 days, it has been proved to reduce the duration of acute diarrhoea by 25 per cent and treatment failure or death due to persistent diarrhoea by 42 per cent. It also prevents episodes of subsequent infections for up to three months[57, 58]. In 2004, WHO and UNICEF recommended that countries adopt the use of Zinc and low osmolarity oral rehydration salts (lo-ORS) in their revised guidelines for treatment of diarrhoea[59]. Zinc was included in WHO model list of essential medicines in 2005 based on the evidence of cost, efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness in the management of diarrhoea[60]. We found one pharmacoeconomic study by Robberstad et al. on Zinc as adjunct therapy which reported it to be cost-effective in Tanzania[23]. Tanzania adopted the new diarrhoea treatment guidelines which incorporated the use of Zinc in July 2007[61] followed by its listing in the national essential medicine list the same year[13]. Our review of documents revealed that a task force committee which was composed of representatives from the government, WHO, UNICEF, and non-governmental organization was formed to advocate for adoption of Zinc[61]. However there is no evidence of whether economic evaluation was among the criteria on which the local decision was based apart from the WHO/UNICEF recommendation.
1449365;5;Injuries/trauma and emergencies is ranked fourth on the disease burden in Tanzania[62]. Victims of injuries/trauma often require blood transfusions to replace the massive amount of blood lost. Other recipients of blood transfusion include pregnant women, patients coming from surgery and those with anaemia. Pregnant women in African settings who need blood transfusions during or after delivery often suffer preventable deaths due to shortages of blood supplies[63]. Even though blood transfusion is considered a lifesaving intervention, it also exposes its recipients to blood-borne viral infections such as HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis B. In Tanzania the average HIV/AIDS prevalence among blood donors has been estimated to be 9 per cent[41]. Shortages of blood supply for transfusions and risks of disease transmissions make alternative options not requiring blood transfusions more attractive. We found two pharmacoeconomic studies on Tranexamic acid (TXA)   an antifibrinolytic drug which reduces post-operative blood loss and transfusion requirements to injury victims[64]. TXA can reduce the risks of death due to bleeding by 21 percent if administered within three hours after injury[34]. For elective surgery, TXA reduces the requirement of blood transfusion by one-third and the volume per transfusion by one unit[33]. The incremental cost-effectiveness of administering TXA to bleeding trauma patients in Tanzania was 48 US$ per LY gained[20], while the incremental cost-effectiveness for surgical bleeding was US $ 93 per life saved[29]. Despite being reported to be very cost-effective in Tanzania, TXA injection is not on the national essential medicine list, but has recently been added to the WHO s model list of essential medicines[65].
1449365;6;TB is ranked sixth on the disease burden in Tanzania in spite of being recognized as having one of the most successful national TB programs in the world, with a treatment success rate of 88 per cent[37]. We found one relatively old economic evaluation study by Murray et al. which compared the cost-effectiveness of short-course versus long-course anti-TB chemotherapies. The study showed that short-course chemotherapy was less costly per death averted and per LY saved when compared to the long, 12-months chemotherapy for both hospital and ambulatory care[31]. The short-course strategy was found to be very cost-effective with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 1 4 US$ per life year saved. In areas with an organized healthcare system the short-course regimen increased the cure rate by a quarter when compared to the standard therapy[31]. Short-course chemotherapy was already introduced in Tanzania before the publication of the study conducted by Murray et al. However, our review of documents showed that the decision to adopt the use of short-course chemotherapy was grounded on evidence of better treatment outcomes at less costs shown by the short-course regimen in Tanzania[66].
359097;1;The successful eradication of smallpox holds many lessons for malaria eradication efforts, despite the considerable differences between the programmes. Smallpox succeeded as a collection of individual country programmes each deriving local solutions to local problems, yet with an important role for WHO and other international entities to facilitate and enable these efforts by ensuring the best possible tools were available, maintaining the disease s profile globally, fundraising, and arm-twisting in reluctant countries to ensure coordinated action. The documented experience of smallpox programmes suggests that such coordinating efforts must be nimble and flexible to stay relevant to rapidly changing country situations, and burdensome bureaucracy must be avoided if international agencies such as WHO are to add value rather than increasing the challenge of disease elimination.
359097;2;Smallpox programme leaders stress the importance of empowering countries to solve problems locally. Where a strategy or tool has been proven to work well, efficient mechanisms for sharing those experiences are essential. Yet each country will need to adapt those effective approaches given their diversity of populations, systems, strengths, and weaknesses. Global leadership for malaria eradication must ensure countries are able to access the most effective tools available and understand the best principles for how to use them, but the smallpox experience suggests there is no script to be followed in elimination, no simple set of check-boxes that if ticked will result in success. Countries did benefit from the provision of international technical advice and logistical support, helping build staff capacity. The particular importance of administrative support to national programmes suggests distinct cadres of staff can add substantial value to malaria elimination programmes: advisors from public health backgrounds can help with technical aspects, but logistical experts are needed to help plan and execute efficient operations. The smallpox experience also emphasizes the critical importance of hiring programme leaders and managers who are enthusiastic about spending time with communities and local programmes, and who are creative thinkers who can derive context-appropriate solutions to the challenging problems that will inevitably arise.
359097;3;Smallpox eradication is reported not to have involved a substantial increase in domestic budgets, but rather was achieved by better managing programmes and streamlining how they spent the available funds. A clear lesson is that data-driven approaches that target resources to the places where they are most needed will be more successful for elimination than mass attempts to achieve universal coverage everywhere; such a shift in mindset proved similarly successful in the eradication of rinderpest, with surveillance-targeted vaccination proving much more impactful than total coverage [96]. Minimizing inefficiencies in malaria programmes to ensure available funds have the greatest possible impact should be a high priority, even while the malaria community continues to advocate for increased funding from donors. In addition, the importance of flexible funding even in small amounts was repeatedly stressed. Setting up a central malaria account that can be rapidly and flexibly used for filling gaps and bypassing bottlenecks could be an important step towards enabling malaria eradication. Means of reducing dependence on donor-funded commodities, such as investment in local manufacturing, may also need to be considered.
359097;4;Building a malaria elimination programme that is visible for fundraising and that has its own discrete, measurable milestones will drive programmes to hold themselves accountable and focus on achieving results rather than just distributing commodities. However, nesting those programmes within basic health services is critical to leverage routine case management and reporting, increasing the sustainability and reach of the programme. While government programmes may direct the fight against malaria, the experience of smallpox eradication also suggests affected communities and the private sector will have critical roles in whether success is achieved.
359097;5;An innate limitation of this review is that it depends upon the published literature, which is constrained by the availability of viewpoints of those who have published [66]. Smallpox was a global undertaking with diverse contributions of healthcare workers at all levels of international and national programmes, yet accounts in the literature are primarily written by director-level staff from the United States and Europe. Accordingly, this review is biased substantially towards the viewpoints of those few individuals who dominate the literature.
362307;1;CEA is a method for evaluating the relative efficiency of alternative interventions and thus can provide important information for assessing the potential implications of the numerous malaria vaccine candidates. This study used stochastic simulations of P. falciparum malaria epidemiology, combined with a case management model, to simulate the cost-effectiveness of potential malaria vaccines under various transmission settings and delivered via different modalities. This is an extension of previous research on pre-erythrocytic vaccines delivered via the EPI[12].
362307;2;The simulations presented suggest that the cost-effectiveness of candidate malaria vaccines is likely to differ substantially according to the transmission intensity and to the delivery modality adopted. They also suggest that alternative vaccine delivery modalities to the EPI may sometimes, but not always, be more cost-effective than the EPI. In general, at moderate vaccine prices, most vaccines and delivery modalities simulated are likely to present cost-effectiveness ratios, which compare favourably with those of other malaria interventions [41 43], making them potential attractive malaria control strategies, from an economic perspective, in malaria endemic countries.
362307;3;These simulations have various limitations, as described in the companion article on the epidemiological effects[14]. For the economic analysis, one of the most important limitations is related to the relatively simple case management model used to assess the impact of malaria vaccines on the costs to the health system and to patients. As the case management model used is the same for all scenarios simulated, the relative cost-effectiveness of the vaccines modeled, and, therefore, the comparisons, should only be slightly affected by it. However, further research and modeling of health system characteristics in malaria endemic settings is required. Additionally, the vaccine delivery modalities modeled may not be feasible to implement in all settings as the coverage and the effectiveness of malaria vaccines is likely to depend strongly on the characteristics of the health systems where they will be implemented, including any other malaria intervention being delivered. For instance, the simulations assumed an EPI coverage rate of 89%, which is probably higher than found in some malaria-endemic countries. Lower EPI coverage rates could have an impact on the comparisons between different delivery modalities.
362307;4;Other limitations of this study include that the comparisons of malaria vaccines   or of combinations of them- with different characteristics, are based on the same assumed vaccine price. In practice, the price might vary according to the characteristics of the vaccines, in particular for combinations of vaccines. This might be important for the result that MSTBV combinations were more efficient than vaccines without MSTBV, especially when delivered via EPI with mass campaigns.  While modeling the costs of different vaccine delivery modalities, the fact that vaccine delivery costs might vary as a function of coverage (as it is the case for other interventions[44, 45]) was not taken into account. This aspect was not considered due to the lack of solid evidence on vaccine delivery costs by coverage levels, especially for mass campaigns.  Despite these limitations, the simulations presented provide interesting information for vaccine developers on the potentials of different candidate malaria vaccines. Previous simulation of the cost-effectiveness of PEV[12] suggested that at moderate to low vaccine prices, a vaccine providing partial protection, and delivered via the EPI, may be a cost-effective intervention in countries where malaria is endemic. The simulations presented in this article, also show that these types of vaccines are more effective and cost-effective in low transmission settings, and that the additional costs of delivering a PEV under other modalities than the EPI are likely to be higher than the additional health benefits. The only exception is for the scenario of mass vaccination (added to routine EPI) in low transmission and for high vaccine efficacies and high coverage. In contrast to PEV, BSV are predicted to be more effective and cost-effective at higher transmission settings than low transmission.
362307;5;Combinations of BSV and PEV are predicted to be more efficient than PEV, in particular in moderate to high transmission settings, but compared to BSV, combinations are more cost-effective in mostly moderate to low transmission settings. The cost-effectiveness ratios of the other delivery modalities simulated are higher than those for EPI alone in almost all scenarios, with the exception of adding mass campaigns to EPI in the lowest transmission setting. Combinations of MSTBV and PEV or PEV and BSV do not increase the effectiveness or the cost-effectiveness compared to PEV and BSV alone when delivered through the EPI (including with the addition of booster doses). However, when applied with EPI and mass vaccinations, combinations with MSTBV provide substantial incremental health benefits and low incremental costs in all transmission settings. These combination vaccines are therefore predicted to be interesting only for the settings where mass vaccination achieving relatively high coverage rates would be feasible.
362307;6;According to these simulations, adding booster doses to the EPI is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to delivering vaccines via the EPI for any vaccine and transmission setting   i.e. the incremental health benefits are rather low despite the additional costs. Mass vaccination improves effectiveness, especially in low transmission settings, and in some scenario the cost-effectiveness ratios compare favourably with those of delivering the vaccine via the EPI only   the incremental costs are lower than the incremental health benefits. However, increasing the coverage of mass vaccination over 50%, often leads to incremental costs that exceed the incremental health benefits. In some scenarios, the lowest cost-effectiveness ratios are reached at intermediate coverage rates of campaigns. This result is particularly relevant as it is due to the indirect effect of the vaccines, and not to the increasing vaccine delivery costs of achieving high coverage rates. In some of the mass vaccination scenarios the simulations predict that local elimination of the parasite would be, in principle, possible. In some of these cases, at moderate vaccine prices, the simulations also predict that the cost-effectiveness ratios of achieving local elimination might be relatively low despite the fact that often the incremental costs of achieving high vaccine coverage are higher than the incremental benefits. However, the cost-effectiveness analyses of these simulations include only part of the economic implications of malaria elimination.
